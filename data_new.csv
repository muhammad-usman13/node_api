Top JavaScript Frameworks and Topics to Learn in 2019,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write Top JavaScript Frameworks and Topics to Learn in 2019 Eric Elliott · Follow Published in JavaScript Scene · 10 min read · Jan 1; 2019 -- 36 Image: Jon Glittenberg Happy New Year 2019 (CC BY 2.0) You fell into the Wayback Machine! Click here to visit 2023. It’s that time of year again: The annual overview of the JavaScript tech ecosystem. Our aim is to highlight the learning topics and technologies with the highest potential job ROI. What are people using in the workforce? What do the trends look like? We’re not attempting to pick what’s best; but instead using a data-driven approach to help you focus on what might actually help you land a job when the interviewer asks you; “do you know __(fill in the blank)__?” We’re not going to look at which ones are the fastest; or which ones have the best code quality. We’ll assume they’re all speed demons and they’re all good enough to get the job done. The focus is on one thing: What’s actually being used at scale? Component Frameworks The big question we’ll look at is the current state of component frameworks; and we’re going to focus primarily on the big three: React; Angular; and Vue.js; primarily because they have all broken far ahead of the rest of the pack in terms of workplace adoption. Last year I noted how fast Vue.js was growing and mentioned it might catch Angular in 2018. That didn’t happen; but it’s still growing very quickly. I also predicted it would have a much harder time converting React users because React has a much stronger user satisfaction rate than Angular — React users simply don’t have a compelling reason to switch. That played out as expected in 2018. React kept a firm grip on its lead in 2018. Interestingly; all three frameworks are still growing exponentially; year over year. Prediction: React Continues to Dominate in 2019 React still has much higher satisfaction ratings than Angular for the third year we’ve been tracking it; and it’s not giving up any ground to challengers. I don’t currently see anything that could challenge it in 2019. Unless something crazy big comes along and disrupts it; React will be the framework to beat again at the end of 2019. Speaking of React; it just keeps getting better. The new React hooks API replaced the class API I’ve been merely tolerating since React 0.14. (The class API still works; but the hooks API is really much better). React’s great API improvements; like better support for code splitting and concurrent rendering (see details); are going to make it really hard to beat in 2019. React is now without a doubt; the most developer friendly front-end framework in the space. I couldn’t recommend it more. Data Sources We’ll look at a handful of key pieces of data to gauge interest and use in the industry: Google Search trends. Not my favorite indicator; but good for a big picture view. Package Downloads. The aim here is to catch real users in the act of using the framework. Job board postings from Indeed.com. Using the same methodology from previous years for consistency. Google Search Trends Framework search trends: Jan 2014 — Dec 2018 React overtook Angular in the search trends in January 2018; and held its lead through the end of the year. Vue.js now holds a visible position on the graph; but still small factor in the search trends. For comparison: last year’s graph: Framework search trends: Jan 2014 — Dec 2017 Package Downloads Package downloads give us a fair indication of what’s actually being used; because developers frequently download the packages they need while they’re working. Overly-clever readers will note that sometimes they download these things from their internal corporate package repos; to which I answer; “why yes; that does happen — to all three frameworks.” All of them have established a foothold in the enterprise; and I’m confident in the averaging power of this data at scale. React Monthly Downloads: 2014–2018 Angular Monthly Downloads: 2014–2018 Vue Monthly Downloads: 2014–2018 Let’s look at a quick visual comparison of the share of downloads: “But you’re forgetting all about Angular 1.0! It’s still huge in the enterprise.” No; I’m not. Angular 1.0 is still used a lot in the enterprise in the same way that Windows XP is still used a lot in the enterprise. It’s definitely out there in enough numbers to notice; but the new versions have long since dwarfed it to the point that it’s now less significant than the other frameworks. Why? Because the software industry at large; and over-all use of JavaScript across all sectors (including the enterprise) is growing so fast that new installs quickly dwarf old installs; even if the legacy apps never upgrade. For evidence; just take another look at those download charts. More downloads in 2018 than in the previous years combined. Job Board Postings Indeed.com aggregates job postings from a variety of job boards. Every year; we tally the job postings¹ mentioning each framework to give you a better idea of what people are hiring for. Here’s what it looks like this year: Dec 2018 Job Board Postings Per Framework React: 24;640 Angular: 19;032 jQuery: 14;272 Vue: 2;816 Ember (not pictured): 2;397 Again; a lot more total jobs this year than the previous year. I dropped Ember because it’s clearly not growing at the rate that everything else is. I wouldn’t recommend learning it to prepare for a future job placement. jQuery and Ember jobs didn’t change much; but everything else grew a lot. Thankfully; the number of new people joining the software engineering field has grown a lot as well in 2018; but we need to continue to hire and train junior developers (meaning we need qualified senior developers to mentor them); or we won’t keep pace with the explosive job growth. For comparison; here’s last year’s chart: Average salary climbed again in 2018; from $110k/year to $111k/year. Anecdotally; the salary listings are lagging new hire expectations; and hiring managers will struggle to hire and retain developers if they don’t adjust for the developer’s market and offer larger pay increases. Retention and poaching continues to be a huge problem in 2018 as employees jump ship for higher paying jobs; elsewhere. Methodology: Job searches were conducted on Indeed.com. To weed out false positives; I paired searches with the keyword “software” to strengthen the chance of relevance; and then multiplied by ~1.5 (roughly the difference between programming job listings that use the word “software” and those that don’t.) All SERPS were sorted by date and spot checked for relevance. The resulting figures aren’t 100% accurate; but they’re good enough for the relative approximations used in this article. JavaScript Fundamentals I say it every year: Focus on the fundamentals. This year you’re getting some extra help. All software development is composition: The act of breaking down complex problems into smaller problems; and composing solutions to those smaller problems to form your application. But when I ask JavaScript interviewees the most fundamental questions in software engineering; “what is function composition?” and “what is object composition?” they almost invariably can’t answer the questions; even though they do them every day. I have long thought this was a very serious problem that needs to be addressed; so I wrote a book on the topic: “Composing Software”. If you learn nothing else in 2019; learn how to compose software well. On TypeScript TypeScript continued to grow in 2018; and it continues to be overrated because type safety does not appear to be a real thing (does not appear to reduce production bug density by much); and type inference in JavaScript without TypeScript’s help is really quite good. You can even use the TypeScript engine to get type inference in normal JavaScript using Visual Studio Code. Or install the Tern.js plugins for your favorite editor. TypeScript continues to fall flat on its face for most higher order functions. Maybe I just don’t know how to use it correctly (after years living with it on a regular basis — in which case; they really need to improve usability; documentation; or both); but I still don’t know how to properly type the map operation in TypeScript; and it seems to be oblivious to anything going on in a transducer. It fails to catch errors; and frequently complains about errors that aren’t really errors at all. It just isn’t flexible or full featured enough to support how I think about software. But I’m still holding out hope that one day it will add the features we need; because as much as its shortcomings frustrate me while trying to use it for real projects; I also love the potential of being able to properly (and selectively) type things when it’s really useful. My current rating: Very cool in very select; restricted use-cases; but overrated; clumsy; and very low ROI for large production apps. Which is ironic; because TypeScript bills itself as “JavaScript that scales”. Perhaps they should add a word: “JavaScript that scales awkwardly.” What we need for JavaScript is a type system modeled more after Haskell’s; and less after Java’s.

That prediction was spot on. One of the major themes of 2017–2018 was the rise of crypto and building the foundations of the internet of value. Remember that phrase. You’re going to hear it a lot; soon. If you’re like me and you’ve been following decentralized apps since the P2P explosion; this has been a long time coming. Now that Bitcoin lit the fuse and showed how decentralized apps can be self-sustaining using cryptocurrencies; the explosion is unstoppable. Bitcoin has grown several orders of magnitude in just a few years. You may have heard that 2018 was a “crypto winter”; and got the idea that the crypto industry is in some sort of trouble. That’s complete nonsense. What really happened was at the end of 2017; Bitcoin hit another 10x multiple in an epic exponential growth curve; and the market pulled back a bit; which happens every time the Bitcoin market cap grows another 10x. Bitcoin 10x Inflection Points In this chart; each arrow starts at another 10x point; and points to the low point on the price correction. Fundraising for crypto ICOs (Initial Coin Offerings) peaked in early 2018; and the 2017–2018 funding bubble brought a rush of new job openings into the ecosystem; peaking at over 10k open jobs in January 2018. It has since settled back to about 2;400 (according to Indeed.com); but we’re still very early and this party is just getting started. There is a lot more to say about the burgeoning crypto industry; but that’s a whole other blog post. If you’re interested; read “Blockchain Platforms and Tech to Watch in 2019”. Other Tech to Watch As predicted last year; these technologies continued to explode in 2018: AI/Machine Learning is in full swing with 30k open jobs at the close of 2018; deep fakes; incredible generative art; amazing video editing capabilities from the research teams at companies like Adobe — there has never been a more exciting time to explore AI. Progressive Web Applications are quickly just becoming how modern web apps are properly built — added features and support from Google; Apple; Microsoft; Amazon; etc. It’s incredible how quickly I’m taking the PWAs on my phone for granted. For example; I don’t have the Twitter Android app installed on my phone anymore. I exclusively use the Twitter PWA instead. AR (Augmented Reality) VR (Virtual Reality) MR (Mixed Reality) all got together and joined forces like Voltron to become XR (eXtended Realty). The future of full-time XR immersion is coming. I’m predicting within 5–10 years for mass adoption of consumer XR glasses. Contact lenses within 20. Thousands of new jobs opened up in 2018; and this industry will continue to explode in 2019. Robotics; Drones; and Autonomous Vehicles Autonomous flying drones are already here; autonomous robots continue to improve; and more autonomous vehicles are sharing the road with us at the end of 2018. These technologies will continue to grow and reshape the world around us through 2019 and into the next 20 years. Quantum Computing progressed admirably in 2018; as predicted; and as predicted; it did not go mainstream; yet. In fact; my prediction; “it may be 2019 or later before the disruption really starts” was likely very optimistic. Researchers in the crypto space have paid extra attention to quantum-safe encryption algorithms (quantum computing will invalidate lots of today’s assumptions about what is expensive to compute; and crypto relies on things being expensive to compute); but in spite of a constant flood of interesting research progress in 2018; a recent report puts things into perspective: “Quantum computing has been on Gartner’s hype list 11 times between 2000 and 2017; each time listed in the earliest stage of the hype cycle and each time said to be more than a decade away.” This reminds me of early AI efforts; which began to heat up in the 1950’s; had limited but interesting success in the 1980’s and 1990’s; but only just started getting really mind-blowing circa 2010.

What I want (and don’t want) to see on your software engineering resume,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write Member-only story What I want (and don’t want) to see on your software engineering resume James S. Fisher · Follow Published in Job Advice for Software Engineers · 8 min read · Jan 1; 2019 -- 25 Asking what should be on a resume is one of the most common questions I hear. I’ve seen thousands of resumes; interviewed hundreds; and hired or helped hire dozens; so I’ll describe exactly what I’m looking for when I’m presented with your application. Photo by Kelly Sikkema on Unsplash Resume or CV? In the US; documents describing your qualifications and work history are called résumés. In the EU and elsewhere known as a curriculum vitae; or CV. Either way; the purpose is the same: a relatively short document which summarizes your skills; work history; education; contact information; and anything else that can be used to estimate your “fit” for a given position. I’m based in the US; so I’ll give a US-centric view of resumes; but I’ll attempt to point out differences with CVs in areas in which I’m familiar. Why do I need one? A resume is required as part of almost every job application. If you see a job listing online and click “Apply;” the next page will almost certainly ask you for your contact information and a resume file. Yes; getting a job is a highly-subjective process that involves interviewing and negotiation; but providing an employer with a resume is the standard first step before any of that can happen. The resume serves to get your foot in the door. After a job listing is published (you can read how job listings are created here); a recruiter or hiring manager will be inundated with applications; and this person (or people) will compare your resume with all of the others; so it’s vital that you provide the same kind of document to put you on an even playing field with everyone else. How long should it be? Do your best to keep it to a single page. A second page is acceptable; but anything past a second page will probably be ignored. Recruiters and hiring managers and other decision makers are usually looking at many resumes at once; so it’s important to put all of your best information up front; above the fold. You can ignore this rule if you’re in academia; where all of your previous work and publications are expected to be listed out. -- 25 Written by James S.

Load Testing Using Apache JMeter,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write Load Testing Using Apache JMeter Mitesh · Follow Published in ITNEXT · 6 min read · Jan 1; 2019 366 1 Photo by VanveenJF on Unsplash Load testing is the process of putting the load through (HTTP; HTTPS; WebSocket etc) calls on any software system to determine its behavior under normal and high load conditions. Load test helps identify maximum requests a software system can handle. It helps determine the point of a bottleneck due to which application starts degrading performance. Load testing is effective when we simulate real user scenario. We need to know how our users behave on our application. Try to replicate their behavior using different API calls and generate load through many concurrent requests at our application for an extended period of time to understand application behavior changes. When we generate load on the system beyond normal usage (high load) to understand application/system behavior; we call it stress testing. Stress testing is done to know the limits of an overall system; understand kind of errors thrown during such load and how the end user is affected. This helps in planning for events when a much higher load is expected by provisioning more infrastructure or optimizing applications. We can use Apache JMeter for load testing static as well as dynamic resources which can generate concurrent users to simulate real user scenario. It also provides graphical analyses of test reports. It is written in Java; so we need to have java runtime installed to run Jmeter. As per JMeter website; it is defined as mentioned below : The Apache JMeter™ application is open source software; a 100% pure Java application designed to load test functional behavior and measure performance. It was originally designed for testing Web Applications but has since expanded to other test functions. Install JMeter on your system from where you want to run your test. I am using Mac OS for running Jmeter and using brew to install JMeter. brew install jmeter We first need to check file descriptors we can open on our system using below command. Every OS has limits on active file descriptors. Every TCP connection takes a file descriptor; so we need to make sure we have enough file descriptor (can set between 1–65535) to run concurrent requests. ulimit -n To start our load test; we need to start with thread groups. They are the beginning point of any test plan. We can specify the number of users (= number of threads) that we want to simulate concurrently. Set ramp-up time which specifies the amount of time it takes to start all threads. We need to define a number of iterations for each user(thread) in the group. Each thread executes the plan independently from other threads. All elements inside single thread will execute sequentially. We can add samplers and logic controllers in a thread group. Samplers help send a request to a server and wait for response i.e. HTTP request sampler to send HTTP request and get the response. Logic controllers help customize the logic to decide when to send a request; modify request etc. Listeners are another type of element which we can add in a thread group. They provide access to information about our load test. Graph result listener helps plot results of our test. View result tree listener shows the detail of request and response. We can add pre-processor and post-processor to a sampler request. Pre-processor executes defined action before sample request and post-processor executes defined action after sample request. Pre-processor can be used to generate dynamic parameters different for each request and post-processor to fetch response parameters to be used by other requests. Config elements are used to configure default value for the samplers. Let’s take a real world example where we are going to create a JMeter test plan with a thread group which can run CRUD operations on user resource at a given server. Each “create user” operation needs to have different email address randomly generated before sending the request. Fetch authentication token and user id provided a response to create user request. An authentication token is used as the header in all subsequent requests and user id in URL and body parameter as needed. Finally; have a view result tree listener where we can see all requests with their responses. Step 1: Add a Thread Group to our test plan Creating a Thread Group Step 2: Add an HTTP request defaults using the config elements to define default parameters like hostname and port of server needed for all requests. Creating HTTP Request Defaults Step 3: Add an HTTP request sampler to send create user request. Creating HTTP Request sampler Add body to create an HTTP request with a dynamic email parameter which is generated by pre-processor. Step 4: Add a BeanShell pre-processor to generate a random email address for creating user request. Creating BeanShell Processor for pre-processing of user HTTP Request Using java code to generate a random number which is used in new email generation for each request. Step 5: Add a JSON extractor post-processor to get authentication token and userId from the response of creating user request. Creating JSON Extractor for post-processing HTTP request Reading token from JSON response using JSON extractor. Step 6: Add an HTTP header manager to add authentication token as the header to all subsequent requests. Creating HTTP Header Manager for sending auth header to all requests Step 7: Add update user; get user and delete user HTTP request sampler for subsequent requests in the same way as creating user HTTP request sampler with userId as dynamic variable fetched from creating user post-processor. Step 8: Add View result tree to get the response to all requests. Creating View Result Tree Listener Finally; we have our user CRUD load test ready which can be used to generate load by increasing the number of users with ramp-up time. This way we can generate different load test plans to know the limits of our applications.

The Illusion of Control in ‘Black Mirror: Bandersnatch’,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write Member-only story The Illusion of Control in ‘Black Mirror: Bandersnatch’ How the interactive film exposes the absence of free will and choice Howard Chai · Follow 8 min read · Jan 1; 2019 -- 10 Black Mirror is a speculative-fiction anthology series created by Charlie Brooker that highlights the dark aspects of modern society; particularly as it relates to our relationship with technology. Each stand-alone episode paints a picture of a world that’s futuristic; yet believable; sleek; yet horrifying. Each of these study guides will examine the themes of a particular episode. All screencaps are mine. W hen we first got word that 2018’s entry of Black Mirror would be “interactive” and a choose-your-own-adventure-style story; I laughed. Black Mirror; with the exception of episodes like “San Junipero” and “Hang the DJ;” is a very pessimistic show. So an episode said to allow you to make choices would undoubtedly be about the illusion of choice; free will; and control. With Bandersnatch now released; that remains true. Choices and Consequences Right off the bat; the first choice you’re presented with is between two breakfast cereals for Stefan. The second is a choice regarding what music Stefan listens to on the bus to Tuckersoft. They’re obviously small choices; serving more as a tutorial for the rest of the episode; a proof of concept that shows your choices will have material effect. Stefan’s fate is in your hands; you can determine how the story unfolds and ends. So many choices; so few consequences. Soon after Stefan arrives at Tuckersoft; there are hints that this might not be the case. As Stefan presents his game to Mr. Thakur and Colin Ritman (played by Will Poulter; who I will never not see as Kenny from We’re the Millers); he arrives at his game’s first fork-in-the-road: Shall the player deny Pax the Demon or worship him? Colin chooses to worship Pax; but Stefan quickly tells him not to choose that. If you; on behalf of Stefan; accept the job at Tuckersoft; Colin then informs you that your choice was a bad one.

The Worst Design Crimes of 2018,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write Member-only story The Worst Design Crimes of 2018 From tech companies exploiting users to voting ballots that undermined democracy; there was plenty of bad design to choose from Fast Company · Follow Published in Fast Company · 5 min read · Jan 1; 2019 -- 10 Photo: Youssef Sarhan/Unsplash By Katharine Schwab 2018 was a year in which design failed us. Sure; there were some bright spots; but in so many cases; software and hardware design seemed to miss the mark. We learned more and more about how tech companies are using design to deceive us; inciting us to share more data; buy more things; and spend more time with their products — but the failures of tech companies paled in comparison to the poor ballot and voting machine design of the midterm elections. These are some of the biggest design failures of a year that offered plenty of them. Dongles and Cracked Screens Though Apple released its most advanced phone ever this year; other aspects of its hardware design left much to be desired. Take the dreaded $9 dongle you need to use any of the company’s new phones with non-Bluetooth headphones. This year; this bit of wire — which users complain breaks easily and is hard to keep track of — became Best Buy’s bestselling Apple product. The fact that it’s such a popular product suggests people are constantly having to replace it; and illustrates how Apple’s 2016 choice to remove the iPhone headphone jack is still a problem for many iPhone owners (it’s the reason why I still have an iPhone 6S; and I’m trying to hang onto the phone for as long as I can). Apple’s design decision that has reverberated across the industry; since most other smartphone makers followed suit—as Fast Company‘s Mark Wilson recently lamented; the Pixel 3 lacks a headphone jack; too.

Make your pictures beautiful with a touch of deep learning magic,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write Member-only story Make your pictures beautiful with a touch of deep learning magic Practicus AI · Follow Published in Towards Data Science · 4 min read · Jan 1; 2019 1.8K 11 Want to be inspired? Come join my Super Quotes newsletter. 😎 Camera technology is beautiful. It’s given us all a chance to save our memories; and to relive them when we see them again in our photos. That technology has come quite a long way over the past several years. With all kinds of new features like 4K; HDR; and colour enhancement; the photos one can capture are awe-inspiring. But it does come at a price. Not everyone can afford the best-of-the-best camera. Consumer DSLR cameras range anywhere from a few hundred to several thousand dollars. Not only that; but not everyone can get the most out of those camera; we’re not all expert photographers after all! Most of us just use our phones. But smartphones often take very bland photos in comparison to high-end DSLRs. Deep learning changes all of that. Beautifying your photos Research from the ETH Zurich’s Computer Vision Lab shows how you can automatically enhance photos taken by low quality cameras and make them look like they were taken by a pro photographer with a DSLR. Here’s how they did it. The team first collected a dataset of low-quality (from cell phones) and high-quality (from DSLR) photos; which you can download from the project page. This is exactly the data we want for such an enhancement task: input a low-quality image (from the phone) and have the deep network try to predict what the high-quality version (from the DSLR) would look like. An image has several attributes that we may want to enhance: lighting; colors; texture; contrast; and sharpness. The deep network is trained to hit on all of these attributes with four different loss functions: Color loss: euclidean distance between the blurred versions of the predicted and target images. Texture loss: based on the classification loss from a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). The GAN is trained to predict whether a grayscale photo is of high or low quality. Since grayscale is used; the network will be nicely focused on the textures of the image rather than color. Create an account to read the full story.

The State of Ruby 2019: Is It Dying?,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write The State of Ruby 2019: Is It Dying? Vinicius Brasil · Follow Published in HackerNoon.com · 3 min read · Jan 2; 2019 468 2 There is a lot of discussion about the Ruby language demise. Well; this balderdash is circulating for a while now; and there are posts from 3+ years ago saying that Ruby is dead; but in fact; here we are. A Google Trends search shows that the Ruby interest over time isn’t decaying; but following the same pattern similar technologies are tracing. Also; always keep in mind that programming languages are tools to solve specific problems; and that is why there is no such thing as the best programming language. Ruby has gone through a lot of significant changes during the past year; and it is certainly not dying; but growing and evolving. The year of 2019 has a lot to the Ruby community. Check some of the key points below: Ruby 2.6 and its new JIT compiler A new version of Ruby has been released in December 2018. This release includes a lot of performance improvements and new features; including an initial implementation of a JIT (Just-In-Time) compiler. To say truly; this new JIT compiler has not achieved its best performance yet; as covered here; but has a lot of future on it. The Ruby community considers this release as an opening to the new era of Ruby. While I failed to make Ruby’s JIT production-ready in 2.6; I don’t regret what we’ve done this year. I needed to develop or lead all of the above things for Ruby 2.6; but I believe I can invest my time mainly on performance improvement in Ruby 2.7. — k0kubun Besides this new JIT compiler; this new release of Ruby has improved performance up to 1.7x; apart from the 5–10% performance improvements from Ruby 2.5.0. Ruby on Rails new release is getting close Ruby on Rails 6 is close. This release includes a lot of cool features that will get web development much easier; as Rails has been doing for years. 2018 has brought a major release; Rails 5.2.x; that included: Active Storage; a modern approach of uploading files straight to the cloud. Redis cache-store HTTP/2 Early Hints Credentials; a new and secure way to store secrets And now; with Rails 6; there are a lot of exciting features; such as: Action Mailbox; a new way to serve to route incoming emails to controller-like mailboxes for processing in Rails Action Text; bringing the Trix editor to the framework Parallel testing; allows you to parallelize your test using forks or threads Webpack as the default JavaScript bundler Ruby isn’t dying; it’s maturing Yes; Ruby was bad and Rails was slow. But that is not true to say in 2018; and won’t be in 2019. Ruby isn’t slow and Rails does scale. If it doesn’t for you; maybe you’ve chosen the wrong tools for the problem you’ve got. In 2019; let’s enjoy programming Ruby 2.6 and Rails 6! Happy New Year!

How to test services; endpoints; and repositories in Spring Boot,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write How to test services; endpoints; and repositories in Spring Boot Emre Savcı · Follow Published in We’ve moved to freeCodeCamp.org/news · 5 min read · Jan 1; 2019 -- 4 In this post I will show you how to write unit tests in spring boot applications. Why is it necessary to write unit test requires another article to explain. But for a brief explanation; I will tell you several things. I usually defend the argument that code without unit tests is dead code. Because; when a developer adds a new feature to some code which is not covered by a unit test; it is prone to override existing business rules (which kills the code written before). Maybe it’s not exactly prone to it; but you can imagine what errors can occur when a complex project needs to be changed. Unit testing is the only way to protect your code against breaking changes. Why unit test endpoints? Every time we write an endpoint we need to be sure several things work correctly. The endpoint should return the data in the correct structure and handle the request correctly. We can test it manually; which is not preferable. So we write unit tests to ensure that our endpoints work correctly. There is also another way for testing endpoints known as automation tests; but that is not the subject of this post. Why unit test services? It should be clear already; but just in case: we need to be sure our business logic works correctly. Why unit test repositories? There are several cases to test repositories. Of course we don’t test the framework itself. But we do write unit tests to be sure that our specifications or relations have been implemented correctly. So how do we test controllers? Now it’s time to show you how to test our controllers in spring boot. Let’s imagine we write an application which allows us to save users in a database. We define a user entity; a user service; and a controller. Note: The examples shown in this post are not for real production use architecture @Data @Entity public class User {     @Id     @GeneratedValue(generator = "uuid2")     @GenericGenerator(name = "uuid2"; strategy = "org.hibernate.id.UUIDGenerator")     @Column(name = "id"; columnDefinition = "BINARY(16)")     private UUID id;     private String name;     private String email;     private int age; } @Data public class CreateUserRequest {     private String name;     private String email;     private int age; } @RestController @RequestMapping("/users") public class UserController {      UserService userService;      @Autowired     public UserController(UserService userService) {         this.userService = userService;     }      @PostMapping     public ResponseEntity<User> createUser(@RequestBody CreateUserRequest request) {          User created = userService.save(request);          return ResponseEntity.ok(created);     } } Our controller has a dependency on UserService but we aren’t interested in what service does right now. So now let’s write a unit test for our controller to be sure it works correctly. We mocked our service because we don’t need its implementation details. We just test our controller here. We use MockMvc here to test our controller and object mapper for serialization purposes. We setup our userService.Save() method to return the desired user object. We passed a request to our controller and after that we checked the returned data with the following line: andExpect(jsonPath("$.name").value(request.getName())) . We have also other methods to use. Here is the list of methods: When we run the test we see that it passes. How do we test services? Now we go to test our UserService. It is quite simple to test. We mock the repository and inject our mocks into UserService. Now when we run the test we’ll see that it passes. Now let’s add a business rule to UserService: let’s say the user must have an email address. We change our save method in UserService as below: public User save(CreateUserRequest request) {     requireNonNull(request.getEmail());          User user = new User();     user.setName(request.getName());     user.setEmail(request.getEmail());     user.setAge(request.getAge());      userRepository.save(user);      return user; } When we run the test again; we’ll see a failed test. Before we fix it; let’s write a test that satisfies this business. We wrote a new test that specified that if we send a null email; it’ll throw NullPointerException. Let’s fix the failed test by adding an email to our request: createUserRequest.setEmail("testemail"); Run both tests: How do we test repositories? Now we’ve come to testing repositories. We use an in memory h2 database with TestEntityManager. Our repository is defined as below: @Repository public interface UserRepository extends JpaRepository<User; Integer>; JpaSpecificationExecutor<User> {     Optional<User> findById(UUID id); } First configure h2db. Create the file name application.yaml in test -> resources path: spring:   application:     name: Spring Boot Rest API   datasource:     type: com.zaxxer.hikari.HikariDataSource     url: "jdbc:h2:mem:test-api;INIT=CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS dbo\\;CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS definitions;DATABASE_TO_UPPER=false;DB_CLOSE_DELAY=-1;DB_CLOSE_ON_EXIT=false;MODE=MSSQLServer"     name:     password:     username:     initialization-mode: never     hikari:       schema: dbo   jpa:     database: H2     database-platform: org.hibernate.dialect.H2Dialect     show-sql: true     hibernate:       ddl-auto: create-drop   test:     database:       replace: none And let’s first write a basic test for our repository: save a user and retrieve it: @RunWith(SpringRunner.class) @DataJpaTest public class UserRepositoryTest {     @Autowired     TestEntityManager entityManager;      @Autowired     UserRepository sut;      @Test     public void it_should_save_user() {         User user = new User();         user.setName("test user");          user = entityManager.persistAndFlush(user);          assertThat(sut.findById(user.getId()).get()).isEqualTo(user);     } } When we run it we’ll see bunch of console output; and also our test passes: Now let’s add another method to our repository for searching for a user via email: Optional<User> findByEmail(String email); And write another test: @Test public void it_should_find_user_byEmail() {     User user = new User();     user.setEmail("testmail@test.com");      user = entityManager.persistAndFlush(user);      assertThat(sut.findByEmail(user.getEmail()).get()).isEqualTo(user); } When we take a look at the console after running the test; we'll see the SQL generated by hibernate: SELECT user0_.id AS id1_1_; user0_.age AS age2_1_; user0_.email AS email3_1_; user0_.name AS name4_1_ FROM user user0_ WHERE user0_.email=? So far so good. We have covered the basics of unit testing with spring boot. Now you don’t have any excuses to not write unit tests!

What Apple Needs to Fix in 2019 (and Beyond),Open in app Sign up Sign in Write Member-only story What Apple Needs to Fix in 2019 (and Beyond) The company may have more cash reserves than most countries but it risks becoming irrelevant unless it fixes glaring problems and starts taking chances Fast Company · Follow Published in Fast Company · 7 min read · Jan 1; 2019 2.3K 23 Photo: Greg Baker/AFP/Getty Images By Jesus Diaz 2018 was a rocky year for Apple. Despite becoming the world’s first trillion-dollar company this summer; it has seen disappointing sales for the latest iPhone — its main cash cow — and; worse; analysts; industry players; journalists; and users believe that the Cupertino company has stopped innovating in favor of milking its user base with marginally updated products at higher price points. It’s a dangerous game that can go south really fast. It’s not that the Apple Watch Series 4 or the new iPad Pro are bad products. They are good. But having a couple of good products and a passable phone is not enough in a hyper-competitive market where companies are working on new form factors for phones; computers; and wearables. The gap between Android and the iPhone widens—Apple has dropped to the number three phone manufacturer worldwide. Microsoft is quickly becoming the PC and tablet gold standard. Web services are dominated by Google and Amazon. And hundreds of companies are trying to create the next big thing. If Apple wants to stay on top; Tim Cook and his minions must fix a lot of things and; perhaps more importantly; start taking risks. Here’s the laundry list for 2019. Streamline the UX Across All Devices As Apple’s product line diversified over the past few years; so did the user experience. Apple needs to streamline its UX across all its hardware platforms. iPhone; iPad; Mac; and Watch are all different hardware platforms that feel similar but are remarkably inconsistent at times. And other times; it’s just bad; introducing hidden features and gestures that are only used by experts. It’s not only about keeping a unified graphic appearance — although that’s important; too. It’s about unifying gestures and UI conventions while keeping it all user-centric; using scientific testing for usability — a UX research process that Apple abandoned a long time ago. If it is successful; all the products in the Apple lineup will offer a seamless… Create an account to read the full story. The author made this story available to Medium members only.

A Practical Intro to Test-Driven Development,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write Member-only story A Practical Intro to Test-Driven Development Test-driven development is hard — here’s the untold truth Luca Piccinelli · Follow Published in Better Programming · 7 min read · Jan 1; 2019 884 5 Image credits to https://testsigma.com/blog/ai-driven-test-automation/ These days you read a ton of articles about all the advantages of test-driven development (TDD); and hear a lot of talks at tech conferences that tell you to: “Do the tests!”; and how cool it is to do them. And you know what? Unfortunately; they are right (not necessarily about the “cool” part; but about the useful part). Tests are a must! The typical advantages we list when it comes to talking about TDD are real: You write better software. You have protection from breaking the world when new features are introduced. Your software is self-documented. You avoid over-engineering. Even if I’ve always agreed with these advantages; there was a time when I thought that I didn’t need TDD to write good and maintainable software. Of course; now; I know I was wrong; but why did I have this idea despite the shiny magic of the pros? There’s only one reason: it costs a lot. The Cost It costs a lot! Someone is probably thinking: “But; it costs even more if you don’t do the tests” — and this is right; too. These two costs come at different times: You do TDD — you have a cost now. You don’t do TDD — you will have a cost in the future. So; how do we come out of this impasse? The most effective way to get something done is by doing it as naturally as possible. The nature of people is to be lazy (here; software developers are the best performers) and greedy; so you have to find a way of reducing the costs now. It’s easy to say; but so hard to do! Here; I will share my experience and what has worked for me in turning the benefit/cost ratio in my favor. But; before I do that; let’s analyze some typical difficulties in applying TDD.

What Elon Musk Got Wrong With Artificial Intelligence,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write Member-only story What Elon Musk Got Wrong With Artificial Intelligence Experts agree that we may not be ready for fully autonomous solutions inc. magazine · Follow Published in Inc Magazine · 4 min read · Jan 1; 2019 -- 8 Musk tweeted; “humans are underrated.” Photo: Joshua Lott/Getty Images By Anne Gherini H erbert Simon; one the inventors of Artificial Intelligence (AI); once remarked; “Machines will be capable; within 20 years; of doing any work a man can do.” Simon made this forward-thinking statement in 1965. What Simon and the other AI proponents failed to appreciate are the numerous unforeseen challenges involved in relying solely on machines. The AI field first emerged more than half a century ago. But it’s only been in the last ten years; due in large part to the rapid growth and democratization of machine learning; that we are starting to see the full potential of AI. Today; there are countless open-source AI tools that help any entrepreneur get up and running on AI quickly; including Google’s TensorFlow; Microsoft’s Cognitive Toolkit; and Amazon Machine Learning. These advancements have accelerated the transition from a model that involves AI assisting humans to one that involves humans assisting AI. This shift to requiring less human capital creates incredible opportunities for businesses to advance. Yet; many technology evangelists are pushing the needle even further and petitioning the eradication of human involvement. The media loves to fixate on these advancements in a Jetsons meets doomsday style of rhetoric. If we follow this line of thinking; it seems logical that humans are only a few short steps from being deemed worthless; demoted to the sideline by the superior droids. It often feels impossible to scan any social media feed without seeing robot dogs effortlessly hopping over obstacles or stories of flying cars solving all of our big city traffic woos. The “space race” for the fully autonomous vehicle already dominates tech’s daily headlines. What seldom is covered with as much vigor is the fact that; despite the massive acceleration in autonomous advancements; humans are still essential. Maybe more so than ever.

How to Download Live Images From Government Weather Satellites,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write Member-only story How to Download Live Images From Government Weather Satellites Alex Wulff · Follow 8 min read · Jan 1; 2019 -- Using nothing but your computer; some software; and a $20 radio dongle you can receive transmissions from NOAA weather satellites in the sky overhead. This is an incredibly exciting project that’s easy to do but produces great images. Think about it — you can receive images from a satellite almost 1000KM straight above you! The Theory NOAA operates a series of weather satellites; designated NOAA 15; NOAA 18; and NOAA 19; that circle the Earth in polar orbits. These satellites are particularly interesting because they’re constantly transmitting an easy-to-decode image signal of what they’re currently looking at. The satellites’ orbits are configured such that one of the three passes within almost every point on the globe every three hours. You can track each of the three here. The closer the yellow line is to your location when the satellite is overhead the higher the satellite will appear in the sky. Keep in mind that the satellites’ trajectories across the globe (the yellow lines) are constantly progressing sideways by a few hundred miles with each successive orbit. You don’t really need to worry about tracking them — I’ll soon introduce a program that calculates the flyovers for you. The images are transmitted line by line via a protocol called APT (Automatic Picture Transmission). It sounds like this: These satellites transmit images at 137 MHz; which is relatively close to both FM radio transmissions (~90 MHz to 110 MHz) and 2-meter amateur radio transmissions (~144 MHz). The data itself is encoded using frequency modulation (FM); the same method that FM stations use to transmit audio. Much of the encoded information is in the range of human hearing; which is why you can actually convert the signals to audio and “hear” them! -- Written by Alex Wulff 350 Followers I'm a Harvard student; maker; and radio enthusiast.

Caching Ethereum events with MySQL,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write Caching Ethereum events with MySQL Oleg Kondrakhanov · Follow Published in Coinmonks · 7 min read · Jan 1; 2019 -- 5 In this article; I am going to demonstrate a simple approach to caching Ethereum events. Here I won’t describe what events are as there are a lot of articles covering that topic (here is the perfect one). I’ll just say that typically we use events for some off-chain operations; for examples tracking token’s transfers or retrieving the filtered list of particular transactions; just like a good old SQL query. Let’s suppose we want to make a website that tracks some token transfers; a kind of Etherscan. We definitely need such simple operations like: get all the token transfers get transfers made from particular Ethereum address get transfers made to particular Ethereum address get transfers that are above or below a particular amount get transfers within particular time frames What we have in web3 now is getPastEvents method; the example usage of which is let events = await contract.getPastEvents(       "Transfer";       {         filter: {from:'0x0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef01234567'};         fromBlock: 0;         toBlock: 'latest'       }     ); The main issue with this approach is it can be slow as blockchain grows; especially if you don’t run your own Ethereum node and use public providers like Infura or MyEtherApi. The next thing — it is almost impossible to implement some tricky queries as filter object’s functionality is quite limited. Besides; events already written to the blockchain can’t be changed; only new records can be added with time. This and other facts make events a perfect target for caching. Database choice In this example; we’ll use MySQL as a database for holding our event records. MySQL has capabilities to store raw JSON and then compose queries using that JSON object’s properties as if they were usual SQL columns. What should we store? Let’s take a closer look at the result of getPastEvents method to realize what data we work with. I took some Binance coin transfers as an example. Each event object has the following structure: {   "address": "0xB8c77482e45F1F44dE1745F52C74426C631bDD52";   "blockHash": "0x19e0d4c4cce0ed7c429b627fc6c5cc5c223c2e9218e233ab2b72e64e817cfcc2";   "blockNumber": 6813922;   "logIndex": 111;   "removed": false;   "transactionHash": "0x32d660785112b084135e0d4d2b53c0d67e851b735eacb486e44e52b7945b857d";   "transactionIndex": 84;   "id": "log_5ea90f71";   "returnValues": {   "0": "0x6ACe7E0abCF0dA3097Fa7155149dccd51E20EF82";   "1": "0xAc951701644936aA95C80ED9f358Fa28f8369075";   "2": "1000553200000000000";   "from": "0x6ACe7E0abCF0dA3097Fa7155149dccd51E20EF82";   "to": "0xAc951701644936aA95C80ED9f358Fa28f8369075";   "value": "1000553200000000000"     };   "event": "Transfer";   "signature": "0xddf252ad1be2c89b69c2b068fc378daa952ba7f163c4a11628f55a4df523b3ef";   "raw": {   "data": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000de2add590e16000";   "topics": [   "0xddf252ad1be2c89b69c2b068fc378daa952ba7f163c4a11628f55a4df523b3ef";   "0x0000000000000000000000006ace7e0abcf0da3097fa7155149dccd51e20ef82";   "0x000000000000000000000000ac951701644936aa95c80ed9f358fa28f8369075      ]     }   } As you can see; the event arguments are stored in returnValues property. blockNumber ; transactionHash; logIndex might be useful too as I’ll show you later. Our goal is to write those JSON objects to the database and to implement easy access methods that can replace standard web3’s getPastEvents method seamlessly. Here is the SQL script for creating the Transfer table. CREATE  TABLE  `eth_cache`.`transfer` (   `id`  INT  NOT  NULL AUTO_INCREMENT;   `json`  JSON  NOT  NULL;   `from`  VARCHAR(45) GENERATED  ALWAYS  AS (json_unquote(json_extract(`json`;'$.returnValues.from'))) VIRTUAL;   `to`  VARCHAR(45) GENERATED  ALWAYS  AS (json_unquote(json_extract(`json`;'$.returnValues.to'))) VIRTUAL;   `value`  VARCHAR(45) GENERATED  ALWAYS  AS (json_unquote(json_extract(`json`;'$.returnValues.value'))) VIRTUAL;   `txHash`  VARCHAR(66) GENERATED  ALWAYS  AS (json_unquote(json_extract(`json`;'$.transactionHash'))) VIRTUAL;   `logIndex`  INT  GENERATED  ALWAYS  AS (json_unquote(json_extract(`json`;'$.logIndex')));   PRIMARY KEY (`id`);   UNIQUE  INDEX  `IDX_UNIQUE` (`txHash`  ASC; `logIndex`  ASC)); Some important things to explain: json column is created as JSON type. This allows us to create auto-generated columns using special syntax from; to; value — these are auto-generated columns. The expression could seem complex at first; but it is really simple in fact. For example; from column value equals to returnValues.from property of the object stored in json column. txHash and logIndex. Combined together these properties identify every event object. We need those to make the unique index for a row; thus preventing occasional duplication of events. Optionally we could also add database index for increasing the performance. For example; for the to column ALTER  TABLE  `eth_cache`.`transfer`   ADD  INDEX  `IDX_TO` (`to`  ASC); Implementation Prerequisites Node.js. I use version 8.4.0. Web3 npm package to interact with the blockchain. We need specific version 1.0.0-beta.35. The usage of latest version beta.36 resulted in the ‘Returned values aren’t valid; did it run Out of Gas’ error when trying to retrieve some events. npm install web3@1.0.0-beta.35 --save 3. To work with MySQL database in JavaScript we should install mysql package npm install mysql --save 4. And the last — MySQL server. It is worth mentioning that we’ll use MySQL 5.7 as the latest 8.0 version doesn’t seem to be compatible with the mysql package (it gave me strange error ER_NOT_SUPPORTED_AUTH_MODE while trying to connect). Interacting with MySQL We’ll utilize connection pool to make queries for this example. const mysql = require('mysql');   let pool = mysql.createPool({    connectionLimit: <connection limit>;    host: <database server address>;    user: <user>;    password: <password>;    database: <name of your database schema>   }); It would be more convenient to use a promisified version of query method const util = require('util');   pool.query = util.promisify(pool.query); Now we can use the following code to insert a record into the transfer table created before. async  function  writeEvent(event) {      try {        await pool.query(          `Insert into \`transfer\` (\`json\`) VALUES    (\'${JSON.stringify(event)}\')`        );      } catch(e) {        //if it's 'duplicate record' error; do nothing;       // otherwise rethrow        if(e.code != 'ER_DUP_ENTRY') {          throw e;        }      }   } Here we also check for possible duplicate rows insertion. Now we don’t want to do anything special in that case; probably we’ve already written those duplicate events earlier or something like this. So we just consider this kind of exceptions handled. Base caching function. Let’s construct a contract object to retrieve events from. let contract = new web3.eth.Contract(abi; <contractAddress>); We can include only Transfer event interface in the abi parameter; like this: let abi = [{   "anonymous": false;   "inputs": [   { "indexed": true; "name": "from"; "type": "address" };   { "indexed": true; "name": "to"; "type": "address" };   { "indexed": false; "name": "value"; "type": "uint256" }   ];   "name": "Transfer";   "type": "event"   }]; This is the base version of the caching function. First; we get event objects; then write them to the database; one by one. async  function  cacheEvents(fromBlock; toBlock) {       let events = await contract.getPastEvents(       "Transfer";       { filter: {}; fromBlock: fromBlock; toBlock: toBlock }       );              for(let event in events) {         await writeEvent(event);       }   } Regular blockchain scanning Now let’s expand this to a simple background script that constantly scans blockchain for the events emitted. Some utility functions const timeout = 30;   function  sleep(milliseconds) {       return  new  Promise(resolve =>          setTimeout(resolve; milliseconds)     );   }      async  function  poll (fn) {       await fn();       await sleep(timeout*1000);       await poll(fn);   } The first one is simple async/await implementation of setTimeout. The second one serves for infinite periodic calls of fn — the worker function. With these helper functions; our background scanner looks quite simple async  function  scan() {       const MaxBlockRange = 500000;       let latestCachedBlock = 0; // latest block written to database     let latestEthBlock = 0; // latest block in blockchain           await poll(async () => {    try {             //get latest block written to the blockchain      latestEthBlock = await web3.eth.getBlockNumber();               //divide huge block ranges to smaller chunks;            // of say 500000 blocks max      latestEthBlock = Math.min(             latestEthBlock;              latestCachedBlock + MaxBlockRange           );            //if it is greater than cached block; search for events      if(latestEthBlock > latestCachedBlock) {        await cacheEvents(latestCachedBlock; latestEthBlock);              //if everything is OK; update cached block value        latestCachedBlock = latestEthBlock + 1;      }    } catch (e) {      //we might want to add some simple logging here      console.log(e.toString());    }     });   } Let me explain that ‘latestEthBlock + 1’ thing. Web3’s getPastEvents(fromBlock; toBlock) returns events written within that [from; to] range; including the borders. So without this incrementing the next cacheEvents call will again return the events written into latestEthBlock as a part of the result. Though duplicate events won’t be inserted into database due to unique index implemented; we still don’t want this excess work to be done. This implementation should be pretty much enough for a simple background scanner. However; there is always room for improvement. We’ll return to it a bit later. Now let’s take a quick look at what we can do now with that data. Retrieving the events Here is an example of the function to select transfers made from a particular address async  function  selectTransfersFrom(sender) {     return  await pool.query(`select json from transfer t where t.from = \'${sender}\'`);   } We query the database using the generated from column. The most notable part here is that the result of the function looks just like the result of web3’s getPastEvents. It makes refactoring the current code a lot easier. Further improvements The event object contains a lot of properties that might be totally useless for your application. It would be better to remove the excess before writing to the database. That way we are saving a lot of space. async  function  writeEvent(event) {       try {    delete event.raw;    delete event.event;    delete event.blockHash;    delete event.type;    delete event.id;    delete event.signature;         await pool.query(             `Insert into \`transfer\` (\`json\`) VALUES (\'${JSON.stringify(event)}\')`    );       } catch(e) {         // if it's 'duplicate record' error; do nothing;        // otherwise rethrow         if(e.code != 'ER_DUP_ENTRY') {    throw e;         }     }   } As you might also have noticed; the current version of the scanner begins with block #0 each time it is restarted. While scanning all the way to current block it will try to insert duplicate records into the database. We can eliminate that excess work by querying the database for the latest cached block. It would be also nice to start scanning not from the block #0; but at least from the block when the contract was deployed. For simplicity; you might get this information using etherscan.io. async function getLatestCachedBlock() {     const defaultInitialBlock = <your contract’s deployment block>;         let dbResult = await pool.query(       'select json_unquote(json_extract(`json`;\'$.blockNumber\')) \    as block from transfer order by id desc limit 1'       );       return dbResult.length > 0 ?      parseInt(dbResult[0].block) :      defaultInitialBlock;   } Here we again use MySQL json functions to get the blockNumber property of the event object. Then replace the old piece of the scan function let latestCachedBlock = 0; with the new one let latestCachedBlock = await getLatestCachedBlock(); Conclusion Finally; we’ve created a simple but working event scanner that continuously caches events into MySQL database.

Why Machine Learning Is So Important For The Future Of Photography,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write Member-only story Why Machine Learning Is So Important For The Future Of Photography Robert Rittmuller · Follow Published in DataDrivenInvestor · 7 min read · Jan 1; 2019 327 3 This is an attempt to clear the air; reduce the hype; and bring some basic understanding to the subject of why machine learning matters so much to the future of photography. I don’t doubt for a moment that the hype around machine learning has roots in some amazing accomplishments; many of which I use almost daily; but when it comes to how the technology affects the world of photography; we need to dig deeper. The story really does start with recent innovations in machine learning; more specifically; the machine learning algorithms that support computer vision. Yes; you could go back further and delve into some of the work done during the last Machine Learning / Artificial Intelligence “Winter” but that’s digging a bit deeper than we need to illustrate why the future of photography depends on these technologies. This CNET post comes close to getting the point across on what the future impact of this technology might be but lacks some real-world examples. What it does get right is that the recent combination within smartphones of machine learning and the latest image processing techniques is what gives us this glimpse into the future of photography. “Machine Learning” — Gives “computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.“ — Arthur Samuel Machine learning in its most basic form is the ability for a computer; or more specifically; an algorithm; to learn from the provided data. Think of it this way; you can teach a child what something looks like by showing them a photo; and if you show them more photos of similar objects they then can then learn to identify an entire class of objects. Machine learning algorithms work essentially the same way (with some important limitations we will discuss shortly) where you show the algorithm large amounts of example data and it can then “learn” to classify that data. If you do it right; that trained algorithm might even be able to classify data it has not been trained on; which is commonly referred to as “generalization”. So that’s the super-simple non-math explanation of how you might build what the machine learning world calls a “classifier” but do understand this is only scratching the surface of how this technology functions.

An ode To Spotify: a good product with great product thinking,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write An ode To Spotify: a good product with great product thinking Viba Mohan · Follow Published in UX Collective · 4 min read · Jan 1; 2019 410 2 If you ask my classmates; they’ll tell you that I’m obsessed with Spotify. I’ve based several of my projects on it. I reference it as a great product while citing examples during class discussions. And you’ll constantly find me advocating for it as the best music streaming service available. This isn’t quite simply because I think Daniel Ek(the founder) is a genius; it’s also because I think the product is a beauty all by itself. So as I look at this IDEO Pop Quiz question “What product do you find the most relevant & interesting?” — to me it‘s a no brainer. It has to be Spotify. Why; you ask? Well for one; think about what our lives looked like before Spotify. Here in India; you’d find people from all walks of life pirating music and then liberally sharing it with their friends. Even a child will be able to tell you that it’s difficult for an artist to make a living in a society like that. Sure; there was the occasional audiophile who’d collect music CDs and care for them like it was worth a fortune — because it was. Photo by Artificial Photography on Unsplash But Spotify was built in an era when trust; in the music industry; was running at an all time low. Record companies would sue individuals and organisations alike for pirating music. And musicians were railing against their fans for the same. They uprooted the existing boundaries of music and redefined them in ways that I still don’t fully understand. They balanced out the needs of artists and their fans. Fans were tired of the tediousness of downloading illegal music and the fiscal costs of actually purchasing music. They were struggling with issues of loyalties to their favourite artists and they weren’t able to discover new music that felt personal yet trendy. Artists on the other hand needed to make a living and needed to truly connect with their audience. So; in the age of commercialisation; they built a product with a vision to simultaneously uplift artists; personalise music for listeners and provide smaller artists with the kind of audience they could only hope to tap into. As a designer; I recognise this to be excellent product thinking. They recognised key opportunities and exploited them in a healthy manner. They listened to their users and adapted as and when needed. To build on personalisation; they integrated a couple of niche features — like Spotify Unwrapped; Spotify Singles; playlists from your favourite artists and Daily Mixes. Spotify Unwrapped not only serves the purpose of being a subtle; high level campaign that markets the product; but also helps users feel more connected to the app and the music that they listen to. In a quaint; unimposing manner it takes you through a memory lane filled with nostalgia and triggers the pride of belonging to an artists fandom. For example; someone listened to 3000 hours of ODESZA on Spotify and now the entire ODESZA community revers him as this sort of legendary #1 fan. They built a community in a way that most apps could only dream of. And they did so by directly adding value to their users lives. Which might be what drew me to Spotify in the first place. While other streaming services cater to the simple tasks of listening to and sharing music; Spotify drew out complex yet subtle interactions that help users connect to artists in ways that they never quite did before. Plus; in this day and age; I think that they are especially relevant because they give artists a voice and a platform to reach an audience they may have otherwise never acquired. The cynic will tell you that streaming services like Spotify are killing artists. But I have a different take on this. The typical artist believes that if they keep playing shows; they’ll one day get discovered and then catapult their way into fame and fortune. But that’s not how the world works. This might be the reality of a privileged few — those who were maybe born into wealth and influence might be able to ease their way into a scenario like this; but for the average Joe; it’s their job to build their career. I’m aware that Spotify pays artists mere pennies for each stream. But the opportunity cost of a service like Spotify is more free ranging than providing an artist with a steady source of income. Spotify won’t build an artists career. It never claimed it would. But it will provide them with the data to locate and analyse their followers; connect them concerts and merchandise and boost the rate at which they are being discovered. It will help an artist find people who connect with their music and it is the job of the artist to transform passive listeners to active fans. People want a fantasy; but Spotify was built for the present day reality. A career in music is a privilege. Not everyone can hope to do this. But Spotify helps make it possible. And in my books this is both interesting and relevant because it mirrors the paradigm shift that is on going in a new society that provides you with unconventional opportunities that when met with creativity can prove to be extremely rewarding. So maybe what I’m trying to say is that I love Spotify because Spotify is a great product with ingenious product thinking.

Top JavaScript Frameworks and Topics to Learn in 2019,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write Top JavaScript Frameworks and Topics to Learn in 2019 Eric Elliott · Follow Published in JavaScript Scene · 10 min read · Jan 1; 2019 -- 36 Image: Jon Glittenberg Happy New Year 2019 (CC BY 2.0) You fell into the Wayback Machine! Click here to visit 2023. It’s that time of year again: The annual overview of the JavaScript tech ecosystem. Our aim is to highlight the learning topics and technologies with the highest potential job ROI. What are people using in the workforce? What do the trends look like? We’re not attempting to pick what’s best; but instead using a data-driven approach to help you focus on what might actually help you land a job when the interviewer asks you; “do you know __(fill in the blank)__?” We’re not going to look at which ones are the fastest; or which ones have the best code quality. We’ll assume they’re all speed demons and they’re all good enough to get the job done. The focus is on one thing: What’s actually being used at scale? Component Frameworks The big question we’ll look at is the current state of component frameworks; and we’re going to focus primarily on the big three: React; Angular; and Vue.js; primarily because they have all broken far ahead of the rest of the pack in terms of workplace adoption. Last year I noted how fast Vue.js was growing and mentioned it might catch Angular in 2018. That didn’t happen; but it’s still growing very quickly. I also predicted it would have a much harder time converting React users because React has a much stronger user satisfaction rate than Angular — React users simply don’t have a compelling reason to switch. That played out as expected in 2018. React kept a firm grip on its lead in 2018. Interestingly; all three frameworks are still growing exponentially; year over year. Prediction: React Continues to Dominate in 2019 React still has much higher satisfaction ratings than Angular for the third year we’ve been tracking it; and it’s not giving up any ground to challengers. I don’t currently see anything that could challenge it in 2019. Unless something crazy big comes along and disrupts it; React will be the framework to beat again at the end of 2019. Speaking of React; it just keeps getting better. The new React hooks API replaced the class API I’ve been merely tolerating since React 0.14. (The class API still works; but the hooks API is really much better). React’s great API improvements; like better support for code splitting and concurrent rendering (see details); are going to make it really hard to beat in 2019. React is now without a doubt; the most developer friendly front-end framework in the space. I couldn’t recommend it more. Data Sources We’ll look at a handful of key pieces of data to gauge interest and use in the industry: Google Search trends. Not my favorite indicator; but good for a big picture view. Package Downloads. The aim here is to catch real users in the act of using the framework. Job board postings from Indeed.com. Using the same methodology from previous years for consistency. Google Search Trends Framework search trends: Jan 2014 — Dec 2018 React overtook Angular in the search trends in January 2018; and held its lead through the end of the year. Vue.js now holds a visible position on the graph; but still small factor in the search trends. For comparison: last year’s graph: Framework search trends: Jan 2014 — Dec 2017 Package Downloads Package downloads give us a fair indication of what’s actually being used; because developers frequently download the packages they need while they’re working. Overly-clever readers will note that sometimes they download these things from their internal corporate package repos; to which I answer; “why yes; that does happen — to all three frameworks.” All of them have established a foothold in the enterprise; and I’m confident in the averaging power of this data at scale. React Monthly Downloads: 2014–2018 Angular Monthly Downloads: 2014–2018 Vue Monthly Downloads: 2014–2018 Let’s look at a quick visual comparison of the share of downloads: “But you’re forgetting all about Angular 1.0! It’s still huge in the enterprise.” No; I’m not. Angular 1.0 is still used a lot in the enterprise in the same way that Windows XP is still used a lot in the enterprise. It’s definitely out there in enough numbers to notice; but the new versions have long since dwarfed it to the point that it’s now less significant than the other frameworks. Why? Because the software industry at large; and over-all use of JavaScript across all sectors (including the enterprise) is growing so fast that new installs quickly dwarf old installs; even if the legacy apps never upgrade. For evidence; just take another look at those download charts. More downloads in 2018 than in the previous years combined. Job Board Postings Indeed.com aggregates job postings from a variety of job boards. Every year; we tally the job postings¹ mentioning each framework to give you a better idea of what people are hiring for. Here’s what it looks like this year: Dec 2018 Job Board Postings Per Framework React: 24;640 Angular: 19;032 jQuery: 14;272 Vue: 2;816 Ember (not pictured): 2;397 Again; a lot more total jobs this year than the previous year. I dropped Ember because it’s clearly not growing at the rate that everything else is. I wouldn’t recommend learning it to prepare for a future job placement. jQuery and Ember jobs didn’t change much; but everything else grew a lot. Thankfully; the number of new people joining the software engineering field has grown a lot as well in 2018; but we need to continue to hire and train junior developers (meaning we need qualified senior developers to mentor them); or we won’t keep pace with the explosive job growth. For comparison; here’s last year’s chart: Average salary climbed again in 2018; from $110k/year to $111k/year. Anecdotally; the salary listings are lagging new hire expectations; and hiring managers will struggle to hire and retain developers if they don’t adjust for the developer’s market and offer larger pay increases. Retention and poaching continues to be a huge problem in 2018 as employees jump ship for higher paying jobs; elsewhere. Methodology: Job searches were conducted on Indeed.com. To weed out false positives; I paired searches with the keyword “software” to strengthen the chance of relevance; and then multiplied by ~1.5 (roughly the difference between programming job listings that use the word “software” and those that don’t.) All SERPS were sorted by date and spot checked for relevance. The resulting figures aren’t 100% accurate; but they’re good enough for the relative approximations used in this article. JavaScript Fundamentals I say it every year: Focus on the fundamentals. This year you’re getting some extra help. All software development is composition: The act of breaking down complex problems into smaller problems; and composing solutions to those smaller problems to form your application. But when I ask JavaScript interviewees the most fundamental questions in software engineering; “what is function composition?” and “what is object composition?” they almost invariably can’t answer the questions; even though they do them every day. I have long thought this was a very serious problem that needs to be addressed; so I wrote a book on the topic: “Composing Software”. If you learn nothing else in 2019; learn how to compose software well. On TypeScript TypeScript continued to grow in 2018; and it continues to be overrated because type safety does not appear to be a real thing (does not appear to reduce production bug density by much); and type inference in JavaScript without TypeScript’s help is really quite good. You can even use the TypeScript engine to get type inference in normal JavaScript using Visual Studio Code. Or install the Tern.js plugins for your favorite editor. TypeScript continues to fall flat on its face for most higher order functions. Maybe I just don’t know how to use it correctly (after years living with it on a regular basis — in which case; they really need to improve usability; documentation; or both); but I still don’t know how to properly type the map operation in TypeScript; and it seems to be oblivious to anything going on in a transducer. It fails to catch errors; and frequently complains about errors that aren’t really errors at all. It just isn’t flexible or full featured enough to support how I think about software. But I’m still holding out hope that one day it will add the features we need; because as much as its shortcomings frustrate me while trying to use it for real projects; I also love the potential of being able to properly (and selectively) type things when it’s really useful. My current rating: Very cool in very select; restricted use-cases; but overrated; clumsy; and very low ROI for large production apps. Which is ironic; because TypeScript bills itself as “JavaScript that scales”. Perhaps they should add a word: “JavaScript that scales awkwardly.” What we need for JavaScript is a type system modeled more after Haskell’s; and less after Java’s. Other JavaScript Tech to Learn GraphQL to query services Redux to manage app state redux-saga to isolate side-effects react-feature-toggles to ease continuous delivery and testing RITEway for beautifully readable unit tests The Rise of the Crypto Industry Last year I predicted that blockchain and fin-tech would be big technologies to watch in 2018. That prediction was spot on. One of the major themes of 2017–2018 was the rise of crypto and building the foundations of the internet of value. Remember that phrase. You’re going to hear it a lot; soon. If you’re like me and you’ve been following decentralized apps since the P2P explosion; this has been a long time coming. Now that Bitcoin lit the fuse and showed how decentralized apps can be self-sustaining using cryptocurrencies; the explosion is unstoppable. Bitcoin has grown several orders of magnitude in just a few years. You may have heard that 2018 was a “crypto winter”; and got the idea that the crypto industry is in some sort of trouble. That’s complete nonsense. What really happened was at the end of 2017; Bitcoin hit another 10x multiple in an epic exponential growth curve; and the market pulled back a bit; which happens every time the Bitcoin market cap grows another 10x. Bitcoin 10x Inflection Points In this chart; each arrow starts at another 10x point; and points to the low point on the price correction. Fundraising for crypto ICOs (Initial Coin Offerings) peaked in early 2018; and the 2017–2018 funding bubble brought a rush of new job openings into the ecosystem; peaking at over 10k open jobs in January 2018. It has since settled back to about 2;400 (according to Indeed.com); but we’re still very early and this party is just getting started. There is a lot more to say about the burgeoning crypto industry; but that’s a whole other blog post. If you’re interested; read “Blockchain Platforms and Tech to Watch in 2019”. Other Tech to Watch As predicted last year; these technologies continued to explode in 2018: AI/Machine Learning is in full swing with 30k open jobs at the close of 2018; deep fakes; incredible generative art; amazing video editing capabilities from the research teams at companies like Adobe — there has never been a more exciting time to explore AI. Progressive Web Applications are quickly just becoming how modern web apps are properly built — added features and support from Google; Apple; Microsoft; Amazon; etc. It’s incredible how quickly I’m taking the PWAs on my phone for granted. For example; I don’t have the Twitter Android app installed on my phone anymore. I exclusively use the Twitter PWA instead. AR (Augmented Reality) VR (Virtual Reality) MR (Mixed Reality) all got together and joined forces like Voltron to become XR (eXtended Realty). The future of full-time XR immersion is coming. I’m predicting within 5–10 years for mass adoption of consumer XR glasses. Contact lenses within 20. Thousands of new jobs opened up in 2018; and this industry will continue to explode in 2019. Robotics; Drones; and Autonomous Vehicles Autonomous flying drones are already here; autonomous robots continue to improve; and more autonomous vehicles are sharing the road with us at the end of 2018. These technologies will continue to grow and reshape the world around us through 2019 and into the next 20 years. Quantum Computing progressed admirably in 2018; as predicted; and as predicted; it did not go mainstream; yet. In fact; my prediction; “it may be 2019 or later before the disruption really starts” was likely very optimistic. Researchers in the crypto space have paid extra attention to quantum-safe encryption algorithms (quantum computing will invalidate lots of today’s assumptions about what is expensive to compute; and crypto relies on things being expensive to compute); but in spite of a constant flood of interesting research progress in 2018; a recent report puts things into perspective: “Quantum computing has been on Gartner’s hype list 11 times between 2000 and 2017; each time listed in the earliest stage of the hype cycle and each time said to be more than a decade away.” This reminds me of early AI efforts; which began to heat up in the 1950’s; had limited but interesting success in the 1980’s and 1990’s; but only just started getting really mind-blowing circa 2010.

Distorted Dreams,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write Distorted Dreams Senthil · Follow Published in DataDrivenInvestor · 10 min read · Jan 1; 2019 -- 1 December month remembers us about a long weekend; friends get together; trip. We are not an exceptional case of this. We have planned for a trip to Wayanad; Kerala from Bangalore by tempo traveler. The trip goes for 3 days. We used to celebrate both the year ending and starting with friends in this kind of trip since 2014. Before the trip start day I called the driver and informed the pickup time is 29 December 4 AM. Some of my friends are going to join this trip and they are coming from Chennai. Always the toughest roads will redirect to a beautiful ending. The same thing happened for my friend Arunjunai in next 3 days. Arunjunai and other folks started their journey towards Bangalore in Kaveri Express on 28 December 9 PM from the central railway station; Chennai. kaveri express train Two weeks back Arunjunai had bought new iPhone XR Worth of 79 Thousand in a single payment. He did his own savings past 6 months to get this phone. Apple iPhone XR Everyone is excited about this trip. Because everyone is going to share their feelings; the good thing; the bad thing happened in the year 2018. I was excited about the following things I am going to tell my body building which I did last 6 month. ‌ I’m going to change my DP on whatsapp which will be captured from Arunjunai iPhone XR Back In the train; they were very excited about the trip and they are enjoying like trolling each other and arunjunai was sitting in the Window seat in s6 coach and he is taking funny photos of others in his iPhone XR. Funny photo of my friend when he was on sleep captured by arunjunai Now the train is crossed ARAKONAM station.; Vellore. The next station is anvarthikanpettai. Its Small station train will stop 2 minutes. Train is stopped in anvarthikanpettai and Arunjunai was sitting in the window seat. The train started moving slowly. Suddenly; someone snatched his phone from outside of the window and he ran away. Visualizing the thief running after the snatch One second Arunjunai was shocked and he couldn’t think what to do.The train already started running in high speed and arunjunai can’t get down. Friends and arunjunai called 180 informed the theft incident to Railway police. They informed to Railway police in train and they said you can raise the complaint and they gave their phone number to arunjunai. Arunjunai exposed his feelings. Arunjunai’s friend started to search how to track iPhone. Somehow They got to know to how to track iPhone. There is an app called find my iPhone which can help to search our iphone phone in case of loss; theft. the below Link will be useful But iPhone should be in the following conditions 1. It should be connected with the internet 2. The phone should have a minimum 2 % charge 3. The phone should not be switched off 4. Apple account should match with your lost account Arunjunai started to use that app but his bad time the thief did not switch on that iPhone. Arunjunai lost his hope. He informed his parents and they felt very bad Arunjunai is worrying about their parent’s feelings. He was very guilty. The train reached Bangalore KR PURAM station; Bangalore at 29 December 4 AM. They informed to Bangalore RPS and they said to go to the majestic station to raise compliant. In order to do compliant; they need IMEI number. But arunjunai left all the documents to his flat in Chennai. Then they decided to register compliant online and will continue our trip. They used the below link to raise compliant in online. They called me. That time Traveler driver’s which booked for this trip phone number switched off. So I went to the station to pick up my friends in my bike to my apartment. While coming back to my flat my friend explained the incident to me. I got shocked and started to scolding arunjunai. We have reached my flat at 5.45 AM and started to discussing on the incident. In order to raise a complaint in online; we need IMEI number. We informed to other friends in Chennai and they send us the details and we did registration The traveler which I booked for this trip met with an accident. They said we can’t come to a trip. Sorry! We are about to drop the plan but still; we were discussing the incident. This sequence of bad events was toiling my mind and likewise; everyone was disturbed in their own way. Meanwhile; the area which he lost his phone is located in my native district. I told to arunjunai we will try. We started to explore on internet. Arunjunai again opened that find my iPhone app on my Mac laptop. Arunjunai already did settings if he lost his phone it will automatically lock and the emergency number will pop up to call. The thief switched on the phone at 8 .30AM Thief mistakenly pressed the pop up emergency number. The number own by one of my friend kalaiyarasan. Immediately we looked that tracking app.it’s started to show the location where the thief currently located. Meanwhile; we have a friend hanish his father is SI (Sub Inspector) We informed about this tracking details. Hanish decided to go there .so he is going to Start at 9.30 AM from Chennai. After 1 hour the thief again did switch off. We can’t track if it’s off. All of my friends who came to my apartment are discussing what to do now? We quickly planned something so that we can continue our trip from next day 30 December onwards and me and arunjunai will go to KATPADI railway station to register a complaint. In a funny way; I named this operation as Mission ARUNJUNAI :) I booked a train ticket. Me and arunjunai started to travel towards KATPADI. From katpadi to anvarthikanpettai by bus. While traveling in train the inspector of RPF ARAKONAM called arunjunai and enquired about the incident. Arunjunai could not recognize thief face; dress color; height weight etc… He is simply blind about a thief. RPF inspector said you would have pulled the chain in a train. But arunjunai didn’t. Finally; an inspector said first register the complaint in a katpadi station. Now hanish reached anvarthikanpettai police station. Police told katpadi station controlling this area you should go there And he said it’s not easy to get back your iPhone. So try to forget it. Arunjunai lost his hope. The train reached katpadi station at 1.50 PM. We went to Katpadi Government Railway Police station(GRPS) They enquired about the incident. We told to katpadi SI ezhil about this tracking details and location. But they are not ready to go there. He said we can’t follow your location. He said we will inform to cybersecurity team of Vellore and they will find by IMEI number. So you should remove the lost mode lock. I asked to head constable about if we get the alert again what should we do? He replied if the device switch on inform to us. We will take care. We will send people to the respective location. Arunjunai had some external influence. They pushed to get FIR(First Information Report) .because of that the inspector of katpadi GRPS got tension and he said you need FIR or phone? why are you pushing us? We will file an FIR and will put your case for pending is this ok ? The inspector behavior was bad to us. We were simply standing and listening. Finally; the inspector told to unlock your phone until we can’t get. Arunjunai did the same. We booked the train from katpadi to Bangalore and reached my apartment by 12.30 AM of 30 December with empty hands. We and arunjunai started the trip. From Bangalore; Indira Nagar at 2.30 AM and we reached Wayanad by 9 AM. Morning arunjunai got the FIR report of his Case. Arunjunai started to enjoy the trip with his fake smile. Inside he was feeling unexplained. Fake laugh of arunjunai( Center person is arunjunai) In wayanad we have covered following place kuruva islands; Basura sagar dam; Meenmutty falls; Pookada lake; Soochipara falls. After covering all these places I confirmed that Kerala is God’s own country After the sunset; we are traveling to the hotel. Now time is 7.30 PM. Again there was a missed call from iPhone to that emergency number. Arunjunai opened the find my iPhone app and started to the tracking number. Again the device is located in the same place. He immediately informed to SIezhil and ezhil said we will send the constable to that place. The constable name is munisamy . He is living near to that tracking place. We are more than 4 people surrounded and watching the movement of the thief. Arunjunai got the contact number of that constable and called. Arunjunai started explaining about where the device located and movement of the device. The constable told I will reach the location in 10 min. Time is now 8.10 PM. next 1 hour is going to be a thriller. Constable Reached the place. Arunjunai explained how to share his live location via WhatsApp. Constable actively listened and followed arunjunai instructions Arunjunai going to redirect the location. When India-Pakistan cricket match and india need 10 runs from 6 balls . dhoni is on strike. All of us hoping on Dhoni. Arunjunai was in the same scenario. He is hoping that thief is going to cought. But worst thing if Dhoni got out we will lose our hope. Same the thief did switch off again. The iPhone went non-trackable mode. All were in lub tub lub tub lub situation. Arunjunai informed to the constable that the last location of the phone and he said thief did switch off. Arunjunai said you’re near to the place. Go straight and take right. But constable munisamy said I’m living in this area. If I go inside is not good. So he arranged one more trustable guy Karthik. Constable munisamy and karthik are standing the street where the device lost his last connectivity. Distance between police and thief Karthik enters inside of that street and arunjunai is telling the route. Karthik is standing the thief exact location which we got from find my Iphone app. Karthik informed to constable munisamy about that thief home. Then constable munisamy said karthi come back. Constable munisamy said we have suspected the thief X person in 70%. But we can’t take any action without confirmation. Constable munisamy said keep track the device if it’s got connect immediately inform to me at any time. Constable munisamy said I will inform about the suspect X person to SI ezhil. Based on his suggestions will take action. Constable munisamy singing off. Arunjunai is feeling to not getting his phone. Me and others are started to enjoy the party in a hotel. We did a campfire and it was awesome. Arunjunai realized that he would have taken insurance of that iPhone. When he bought an iPhone XR from showroom he didn’t take insurance. If would have taken he can claim. Time almost 1 AM 31 December-midnight. All of us feeling the sleepy mood. So we went to a room to sleep. Morning we got a call from SI Ezhil and he said we got the culprit. The suspected X person is the thief. We got your phone. We will send you photos of your phone. That Time arunjunai was in deep sleep. Arunjunai gets up from a bed and we informed your phone found. Arunjunai is very happy now. He was flying on the happiness. SI ezhil called to arunjunai in order to confirm your phone we need IMEI and bill document. Arunjunai said I can unlock my phone and I can trigger alarm sound. Arunjunai did and police confirm that this is arunjunai phone. SI ezhil said come today( 31 December) to KATPADI GRPS. But arunjunai said I’m in Wayanad. I will come tomorrow(1 January) . SI ezhil said come on 2 January; we will hand over your phone in front of the Katpad Railwat station court. Arunjunai thanked them a lot. I can see his happiness after his phone found. He will go to katpadi on 2 January and will collect his phone. In earlier I mentioned the hardest route will end in a good destination. It’s happened for arunjunai. Arunjunai Arunjunai going to Start the new year with his sexy iPhone XR with an awesome experience Technology is always a boon. We tasted it. I hope this might be helpful to someone.

2018: A Year in Review,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write 2018: A Year in Review Sarah Hubbard · Follow 10 min read · Jan 2; 2019 58 Traveled to ten countries. Worked on three different teams at Microsoft. Got a puppy. Spoke at GHC. Woah — this is the fifth edition of my year in review!! (See 2014; 2015; 2016; 2017) Feels crazy that five years have flown by. Below I’ll capture some of my favorite highlights of the year and goals for next year. This years post turned out to be a bit longer than previous ones! I created a 1 second per day video this year! I missed a handful of days; usually mid-work week; but for the most part this shows every day of my year. I’ve already loved looking back on this probably a hundred times throughout the year — it brings me so much joy looking through the little moments and people that make day-to-day life so special. Check it out: I’m so grateful for some of the places I’ve had the chance to visit and some of the highlights of the year; but I will preface this all by saying *most* of my days lately consist of working long hours (not seeing the sun and jumping between conference rooms; morning + afternoon coffees); coming home and taking care of Ollie or talking with Josiah; sometimes making dinner; and sometimes continuing to work from the couch. I don’t document these moments as much; but they make up the majority of my time. What most days look like: My desk in Building 40 / Meetings and whiteboards / Watching all the pups play together The Bigger Things of 2018 A huge rollercoaster this year was switching teams within Microsoft. After close to ~30 interviews/coffee meetings I made the decision to switch from Skype to a Mixed Reality Incubation team. I started working on an educational VR project and also found out the entire org was going to be cut the first week I joined. Sensing the turmoil here; I was able to switch over to another team; Azure IoT; that I’m really excited about. This ended up being close to a 6 month process— prepping for interviews; interviews; wrapping up work; starting new work; everything falling apart; starting over again — I felt really behind and spent all my time outside of work dealing with figuring out work. However; it does feel like it was all worth it! I’m in a place now that is supportive; challenging; fast-paced; and with lots of opportunity. I’ve already learned a lot and am excited for the potential growth here. The other big life change was getting a French Bulldog puppy; named Ollie (@olliethefrenchiepup); with Josiah. Ollie has become such a huge part of both our lives and I have so much love for our little fam. It’s really the first time another being has depended on me and my actions — there has definitely been a shift towards more deeply understanding the responsibility of providing for another life. Puppy training has been frustrating at times; but all worth the work. One day this fall; Ollie had a terrible seizure; and we rushed him to the emergency hospital immediately. It was one of the most frightening moments I’ve experienced. We believe he has epilepsy; which has added to our caregiving responsibilities. Josiah and Ollie are such a big part of my life; daily routines to the park and lounging on the couch together; it’s hard to imagine life now without our little pup. Our little pup Ollie! He loves hiking; snoring; butt scratches; playing with all his pup friends; and extra cuddles. Birthdays are moments I feel very very grateful for; but it has started feeling weird to get older (time is going too fast!) Overall; what I find myself most anxious about is this constant pressure I put on myself to have all the answers. Sometimes it feels like there are so many things I want to do; but not enough time in this lifetime to do them all. It feels like age 30 is some sort of looming deadline to have life figured out — starting a family; doing work that is fulfilling; being successful and happy; and settling down in one place. Although I’m making progress towards these goals I care about; it still feels like a ticking clock. I can’t help but mull-over all the possible paths I could take — should I go to grad school (if so; for what) or work somewhere different or move somewhere international or sell everything and go backpack around — sometimes it feels like there are a lot of doors open and closed at the same time. I’m not exactly sure what I want my dream career to be or where I see myself 5 or 10 years from now. As more of my friends from high school are engaged; married; or have kids; it makes me feel old and like I should have my whole life figured out by now. I end up reminding myself that each year when I write these posts; more happens in life each year than you can ever predict; opportunities arise; and tragedy strikes. I have to remember that as long as the actions I take keep aligning towards my principles or north star; the answers figure themselves out along the way. Plus; as much as I crave answers; I’d much prefer figuring out ambiguity and am learning to let go of this need for control. I’m starting to practice that instead of “analysis paralysis” or trying to keep all these options open; making a big decision and then jumping in and rolling with it; feels so much better. Places I visited this year — including a new continent; South America! Surpassed my reading challenge for the year; woohoo! Favorite show: The Newsroom (older show; just watched) Favorite movies: The Post & BlackkKlansman Favorite failure: I really wanted to work on the Mixed Reality team— I took Unity classes for months; interview prepped; went to Seattle VR meetups; and tried out all the devices. I interviewed for a position I really thought I had and didn’t get it. When I finally got a different position it got cut the week I joined. I was crushed to work so hard for something and see it crumble as soon as I had it in my hands. Looking back; it all worked out in the end. Here are a few (mostly chronological) highlights from 2018: Rahil came to visit! We went snowshoeing and drove up to explore Vancouver; Canada. Spent a week in Belize with Josiah’s family — hanging out in the beach town; snorkeling with sharks; and learning to fish. I wrote more about our Belize trip here. Went to the mountains for a few weekend trips. One girls trip to the Olympic Peninsula (with Puja; Alex; Caitlyn; and Annie) and another to Steven’s Pass for ski lessons. Brought my friends from Seattle to Austin; Texas; for the very first time. I love combining these places and people in the two places that are home. Rahil snowshoeing in Snoqualmie; WA / Coconut stand in Caye Caulker; Belize / Allen’s Boots in Austin; TX Took my first international work trip to Prague with Skype! Had the chance to also take side trips to Budapest (mostly by myself) and Vienna (with Austin) while there. Széchenyi Thermal Bath in Budapest / Trdelník in Prague / Beers in Vienna Josiah and I joined Thomas; Kianna; and Philip; on the Greek islands for a week. We visited Santorini and Crete; ate gyros for just about every meal; and soaked up the sun next to crystal blue water. Coast of Santorini / Three blue domes in Oia / Goats on Balos Beach Raised Ollie with Josiah. Launched the Azure IoT Central product. (This is a feature I worked on before the launch.) It was pretty stressful before the launch; working nights and some weekends; but it is exciting to be working in this space! Met up with my family in Cusco; Peru; and hiked the entire Inca Trail to Machu Picchu. I wrote more about this trip here. This was my first backpacking trip; first time in South America; and first wonder of the world! It was the most physically challenging; but breathtaking; trip I’ve ever taken and I really would love to do another hiking trip in 2019. Starting the Inca Trail / Alpacas surrounded by the Andes / Reaching the end of the trek at Machu Picchu! Josiah and I moved into our new dream; modern apartment (right across the street from our apartment last year) right in downtown. I always dreamed as a girl I’d live in an apartment in the city and dress up everyday for a fancy job — I don’t realize it on a daily basis; but this is the kind of life I hoped to have when I was “older”; it just doesn’t feel like I’m the “older” girl I used to want to be. I’ve been trying to use the space to host and bring people together more! Part of our apartment in downtown Seattle; WA I can run a mile without stopping now; woohoo! Tried to get out and do some more hiking around WA this summer. Surprised Josiah and I with going on our first helicopter ride. Trying to host more things that bring people together / Chain Lakes Loop hike with Ollie; Alex; and Annie / Helicopter ride with Josiah over Seattle Spoke at the Grace Hopper Conference in Houston at two different sessions. One session was at the Technical Executive Forum in front of a couple hundred C-Suite Execs on the Reverse-Mentoring Program I’ve been working on at Microsoft. The other session was a panel on Technology & Ethics with some incredible women! Josiah and I visited Thomas and Kianna in Bali; Indonesia; and stopped by Tokyo; Japan; along the way there. Josiah and I both thought this was probably the best trip we’d ever taken before. In Tokyo; we did an awesome Mario Cart racing in go-karts along the city streets. In Bali; we hung out at the beach; ate beautiful vegan foods; got massages; and motorbiked into the jungle to stay at an all-bamboo house. I wrote more about our Bali trip here. Panel at GHC in Houston; TX / Mario Cart driving at Tokyo Tower / Surrounded by rice terraces at our all-bamboo airbnb in Bali; Indonesia Right now; I’m writing this from Florida; where I’ve had the chance to soak up a bunch of family and sunshine! So happy to just relax with family — lazy days walking on the beach and watching Hallmark movies. Things I want to do in 2019: It’s starting to sink in that the concrete goals I set for myself; I tend to accomplish; and the vague ones show up year after year. I’m going to try to have fewer; concrete actions for 2019. I want to establish routine! The times I’m waking up/falling asleep; eating; working out; working hours etc. Routine automates good habits. Now that I’m in a solid position and team at work; I want to be promoted to PM II this year. I have a separate document with some of the concrete actions I’m going to take in the context of work to make that happen. I’m either going to take the GRE; GMAT; or figure out another way to start continuing education courses. I’m going to apply to some kind of continuing education program this year. Fitness is always on my list and even though I think I’ve made slow progress in this department; it still isn’t a habit. I’m going to workout at least 2-3 times a week. The one concrete goal I met was reading 15 books in 2018. My goal for 2019 is to read 20 books. I’ll be tracking this on Goodreads. I’m going to write a Medium post for every trip I take. I love looking back on these trip guides and they contain so much more detail than I can recall in hindsight. I had honestly never even heard of Azure IoT last year; and now I work there. I hadn’t planned on going to Machu Picchu anytime soon; and this year my family and I hiked for days to see the wonder of the world. I was excited to attend GHC for the first time last year; but had no idea I’d get the chance to speak there this year in front of hundreds of people. It’s astounding how little I could predict about 2018. And 2019 will undoubtedly bring the same unknowns. “The best part of the journey is the surprise and wonder along the way” - Ken Poirot Thank you for being a part of my journey.

SAFE SPACE: The Strange Rise Of Dating Apps For The Far-Right,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write Member-only story SAFE SPACE: The Strange Rise Of Dating Apps For The Far-Right “NOTHING BUT LOVE FOR MY PRESIDENT” Bailey Steen · Follow 6 min read · Jan 1; 2019 100 3 The dating scene isn’t easy for Republicans. As users cite “rejection discrimination” on mainstream platforms such as Tinder; Bumble; Hinge; and OkCupid; several reactionary right-wing independent dating apps have begun flooding the market promising to deliver on these lustful safe spaces. Just like their prefered politicians; however; the irony is incredibly rich. “This app is about love for conservatives by conservatives;” declared Righter founder Christy Edwards Lawton; the die-hard Trump supporter who spoke with Vox about leftist hegemony over the market. “I think people should date who they want to date. If you want to date a blonde; date a blonde. If you want to date a skinny person; date a skinny person. I don’t think that’s discrimination;” she added; “[but] they’re the ones telling us how racist we are; and how shortsighted we are; and it’s like; really? I just feel like it’s very rude. Get on a different app; [leftists]. Righter is not the app for you.” Righter; nonetheless; still follows the footsteps of the reactionary competition such as Conservatives Only; Donald Daters; Dating Republicans; TrumpSingles; Gun Lovers Passions; Patrio; and countless more across America. Emily Moreno; the founder of Donald Daters; credits her cite to the left for their behaviour of walking out on dates “before the drinks had even arrived” if they’re discovered to be supporters of the GOP. As framed by journalist Gaby Del Valle; “these conservative apps think liberals who refuse to date conservatives are doing something more destructive than looking for partners who share their values. To them; it amounts to anti-conservative discrimination… which [Moreno] said has intensified under Trump.” This is funny given the foundation of Trump’s rise; along with the banter from his base; is about culture-war provocation; as seen in Righter’s own Instagram post where a picture of migrants waiting at a border wall being caption: “ACCESS DENIED” while US soldiers are stringing barbed wire with the words “FREE BENEFITS”; granting veterans premium access to the site. Moreno told the publication: Create an account to read the full story. The author made this story available to Medium members only.

AI Competition Is the New Space Race,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write Member-only story AI Competition Is the New Space Race The technology still has a long way to go despite progress in 2018. The EU; U.S. and China are all determined not to be left behind. Bloomberg Opinion · Follow Published in Bloomberg Opinion · 5 min read · Jan 1; 2019 139 2 China’s 19-year-old Go player Ke Jie (L) prepares to make a move during the second match against Google’s artificial intelligence programme AlphaGo in Wuzhen; eastern China’s Zhejiang province on May 25; 2017. Photo: STR/AFP/Getty Images By Leonid Bershidsky It’s been another year of relentless artificial-intelligence hype and incremental AI achievement. Machines still beat humans only in carefully constructed environments or at narrow tasks. The good news is that; as the technology progresses; the race for leadership is still wide open; and even Europe; where politicians fret that the continent is lagging behind China and the U.S.; is still quite competitive. According to the Artificial Intelligence Index 2018 annual report; whose steering committee includes leading AI scholars such as Yoav Shoham of Stanford University and Erik Brynjolfsson of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology; AI has progressed on all the measures tracked. Some of the metrics; from the number of published papers and conference attendance; to mentions on corporate earnings calls and in parliamentary hearings; measure the hype. Others reflect improving performance. This year; AI has gotten more accurate and much faster at image detection. It’s also improved at parsing the grammatical structure of sentences; answering multiple-choice questions and translation. Whether this progress brings us closer to truly superhuman AI is a different matter. On the translation front; a measure called Bilingual Evaluation Understudy is used to determine accuracy. It compares machine-translated sentences to those rendered by human experts; and this year almost half the machine translations between English and German news articles measured up to the human ones. This year; Microsoft announced with much fanfare that its AI did just as well as humans in translating news from Chinese into English. But the underlying paper reports much lower scores for the Chinese translations than for the separately published German ones; and accuracy scores from human evaluators of between 50 percent and 70 percent. Machine-translation algorithms still produce plenty of gibberish and are really mostly useful; in a limited way; to humans with some understanding of both languages and the context.

2018 Review: What I learned in 100 days Blockchain Events,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write 2018 Review: What I learned in 100 days Blockchain Events Version 1.1 with many pictures Claudio · Follow Published in #NextLevelGermanEngineering · 7 min read · Jan 2; 2019 159 From AI to Blockchain Coming from machine learning (deep learning) and leading a data science team in 2017; I wanted to utilise this knowledge in the field of Blockchain. With friends we used our New Year’s holiday to a have a private programming trip and analysed financial as well as social media trends in correlation to cryptocurrencies values. Already June 2017 we organised a first Meetup in Berlin and soon at a Hackathon the idea came up to forecast the crypto values with deep learning. My Resume; the long-term global Bitcoin trend couldn’t be predicted accurately; because the internet currency is not a repetition of a similar pattern. And after our programming holidays; we had to focus on job tasks. Alled with BBB ended quickly after a hackathon group participant secretly; see this git commit; placed a coin miner on our site — it’s uncomfortable with me to this day Blockchain technology stands for much more than just cryptocurrencies You hear much about cryptocurrencies; but the really special thing about it actually the concept behind it; the Blockchain technology. In order to understand Blockhain one has to understand the technological fundamentals; consenus algorithms; the functioning of fullnodes and the peculiarities of different platforms. Over the time I could get to know a lot of projects in many blockchain-focused co-working offices like Transistor; Full Node; rent24; WeWork; Factory/ies; TechCode; nakamo.to; etc. Within the framework of the projects in the Porsche Digital Lab in Berlin we were able to do exactly that. We have worked our way up from the basics to smart contract programming. This has laid a very good foundation and allowed us to solidly evaluate use and business cases. Hackathons are a great way to learn & try out fast use case ideas In many Hackathon events you could get to know a ton of Blockchain ideas; great people and new technologies first hand. These were often cross-industry and showed the whole field of possibilities. The participation at Hackathons was a lot of fun and instructive; on the pictures with my teams from Ethereum Camp to Blockchain + IoT and the Universal Studios Musicathon at MHPLab. Especially exciting were the three hackathons; where I worked for Porsche with Volkswagen AG; Zalando and Adidas; where we could support social entrepreneurs with supply chain transparency. Here at the three Hackthons organized by n3xtcoder with my teams in the MHPLab (in the house of the PDLB); at Zalando and the Volkswagen Digital Lab. The Blockchain world is already colorful and very diverse Once one has explored the basics of block chains and transactions; including different consensus methods; it becomes clear what the advantages and disadvantages of the technology are. And also where there are limits. The original blockchain is supposed to make intermediaries unnecessary and distribute the trust ‘censorship free’ fairly among all users; but today’s proof-of-work (PoW) approach devours vast amounts of energy. Even the alternatives have not yet been able to assert themselves. Distributed computing and smart contracts are interesting for companies and process design. However; such a network grows virally if it is ensured that the investment costs are secure in the long term (e.g. through public permissionless systems without PoW). Visiting Meetups to learn about specific topics helped a lot: Meetups from Digital Assets; to Tangle Developers; IoT-Blockchain platforms; IPFS; ORM Blockchain; Hardware embedded Blockchains;… The future of Blockchain is not Blockchain: D(L)T; zero knowledge proofs; dApps & quantum secure computing Although most blockchain platform ideas have not yet been implemented and are far from a productive stage and ‘blockchain nowadays mainly runs on PowerPoint’ (citing Ingo Brenckmann) — we already looked at the following technologies. Beside the immutable Ledger of a Blockchain we need for example for the privacy and the data protection (also in the sense of GDPR) also erasable and encrypted data (e.g. with personal data). A blockchain seldom comes alone and needs a distributed file system. Here also Quantum secure encryption plays a big role — this topic we also deal with in 2019. Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLT) also include other methods that are of application-specific interest; such as the ‘Gossip over Gossip’ protocol (e.g. from HashGraph) or decentralized Tangle (e.g. described by Helix). When we think about the future of blockchain applications; Smart Contracts and distributed computing play the most important role. Designed with zero knowledge proofs such as ZK-STARKs and zk-SNARKs in mind; these programs would no longer have to be executed in parallel on all blockchain network participants; but only on a single one — verifiable by the others. Thus; the complexity of the programs can be increased ten thousand times nowadays. And then; in the more distant future; whole applications can run decentrally; so-called dApps. The Web3 summit is the ‘Web summit’ for blockchain enthusiast; it’s a great mix of new research and best practices; e.g. STARKS & Web3.js. Sharing knowledge After an intense period of information gathering and testing with prototyping; I was able to share some knowledge in presentations and share it on one or the other panel. In Birmingham; presenting the Porsche & Xain Blockchain in a Panamera Case & panel talk— https://xain.io Glad to present as representative of Anja Hendel at the Hightech Summit Baden-Württemberg 2018 (Rottweil) with Nick de la Forge. At the Blockstack we could present with Erwin our findings about asset management; at CODE about Blockchain at Porsche; and with Deniel at the First Tuesday about our vision for this platform technology. There were several internal events for Porsche internal workshops; meetings and presentations I could attend; like this one at the Porsche Museum; organised by the Mannheim Business School. Relevant areas besides payment are record keeping (e.g. vehicle history); distributed computing (e.g. supply chain product lifecycle) and property & asset management with token. Many useful applications can be sorted into one of the categories — but are still at different stages of implementation and deployment. RECORD KEEPING: The protection against data manipulation of any information is an optimal and very feasible task for Blockchain. For this purpose; only the digital fingerprints (e.g. hashes) have to be written on a secure network. (For example for secure video timestamping by my colleague Jagrut Kosti) PAYMENT: In order to bring a payment service to the masses by means of security tokens on blockchain (e.g. into a car; which pays the parking fees itself); you need more price-stable; less volatile cryptocurrencies. This can be done through extremely high market penetration or more likely through government guarantees / regulation. But both can take a long time and are difficult to influence. DISTRIBUTED COMPUTING / SMART CONTRACTS: This creates stable; upwardly compatible interfaces between players / users and companies. SUPPLY CHAIN and PRODUCT LIFECYCLE are a particularly large field of application in this context — this area may also grow together across industries. SECURITY TOKEN: According to studies; the token as a certificate of ownership of real values or representation of a value (e.g. of company shares) will take a heavy toll; but also requires stronger regulation through a clear legislative statement. What’s for 2019? In 2018 we took the technology apart and learned a lot. This makes it easy to investigate the usefulness and feasibility of use cases. In 2019; it becomes important to focus on the user benefit of blockchain & DLT and to calculate business models for these platforms. After all; you want to see the first real use cases in production.

Toyota Wants to Put a Robot in Every Home and Make It Your Pal,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write Member-only story Toyota Wants to Put a Robot in Every Home and Make It Your Pal Bloomberg · Follow Published in Bloomberg · 4 min read · Jan 1; 2019 58 Photo: Toru Yamanaka/AFP/Getty Images By Kevin Buckland Toyota Motor Corp. has sold enough cars to put one outside every Japanese home. Now it wants to put robots inside. Well-known for its automated assembly lines; Toyota sees a not-so-far-off future in which robots transcend the factory and become commonplace in homes; helping with chores — and even offering companionship — in an aging society where a quarter of the population is over 65 and millions of seniors live alone. Machines have become much smarter in the last decade or so. Yet; every attempt to build one that can do simple things like load a washing machine or carry groceries encounters the same basic; physical problem: the stronger a robot gets; the heavier and more dangerous it becomes. What Toyota has going for it are $29 billion in cash reserves; a new artificial intelligence research center and a well-respected inventor; Gill Pratt; heading its effort. “This is a company with so many resources that you can never ignore them;” said Morten Paulsen; a Tokyo-based analyst at CLSA Japan Securities Co.; who’s covered the robotics industry for decades. Toyota has been experimenting with robots since at least 2004; when it unveiled a trumpet-playing humanoid with artificial lips; lungs and movable fingers that could accompany an actual human orchestra. Android Avatar Toyota T-HR3 humanoid robot. Photo: Kiyoshi Ota/Bloomberg Since then research has become more practical. Toyota’s latest android; the T-HR3; is a kind of avatar that can be manipulated remotely via wearable controls; with vision goggles that allow users to see through the machine’s camera-eyes. The device could one day serve as arms and legs for the bedridden; or as a surrogate for relief workers in disaster zones. In 2015 the automaker spent a billion dollars to open its AI-focused Toyota Research Institute in Silicon Valley. Last year it set up a $100 million fund to invest in startups and new robotics technology. This year the company restructured its Partner Robot division to speed decision-making and shorten development time. Create an account to read the full story.

Maker Creates a Voice-Operated Camera for a Journalist Who Is Quadriplegic,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write Maker Creates a Voice-Operated Camera for a Journalist Who Is Quadriplegic Cameron Coward · Follow 2 min read · Jan 1; 2019 89 1 Carolyn Pioro used to be a trapeze performer for a Toronto-based circus. But; in 2005; she was tragically and terribly injured during training when she fell 40 feet and a landed badly on the safety net; severing her spinal cord. With her trapeze career cut short; she enrolled at Centennial College in a contemporary journalism program. She wanted to shoot a photo essay on the performance she loved; but was unable to find an accessible camera option that fit her needs. So; Taras Slawnych stepped in to create one for her. Slawnych is maker; and the visual editor for the Toronto’s Star newspaper. He heard about Pioro’s situation from Star’s photographer Steve Russell; who is a friend of Pioro’s professor Tyler Anderson. Slawnych figured he could come up with a way for Pioro to snap photos; and set out to build it. Because Pioro is quadriplegic; the camera needed to be completely hands free — not only the shutter release; but also panning and tilting. The device Slawnych came up with sits inside a 3D-printed enclosure attached to Pioro’s wheelchair. It takes the 24V battery power from the wheelchair and steps it down to 12V to power the components. Those are an Arduino; servos; and microphone. By interpreting Pioro’s voice commands; the device can pan; tilt; and trigger the camera so she can shoot all the photos she likes on her own. Slawnych even took the device to Canon Canada; who has expressed interest in expanding the design to include zoom functionality.

A Social Good Story in the Age of the Opioid Crisis (2018 Recap by Fiduscript),Open in app Sign up Sign in Write Member-only story A Social Good Story in the Age of the Opioid Crisis (2018 Recap by Fiduscript) James Lott · Follow Published in DataDrivenInvestor · 7 min read · Jan 1; 2019 56 Fiduscript; a Public Benefit Corporation Co-Founders James Lott (left) and Straker Carryer (right) preparing for a presentation to the Food and Drug Administration (Dec 2018) W ow; 2018 — What a year. In 2017; our work was hardly an idea. We are now months away from launching; and have built a supportive network of amazing colleagues; mentors; advisors; business partners; investors; and most importantly advocates who champion the work our team is doing. We’re tackling the opioid crisis with our flagship service Naloxone Exchange; an online marketplace where anyone can purchase the life-saving opioid antidote Naloxone; receive effective training on how to use it; and have it delivered to their door. In short; this medication is a miracle drug that gives people a second shot at life. In fact; its brand (Narcan) made by Adapt Pharma is the same drug that has revived thousands of people; including celebrity musician Demi Lovato. When 72;000 people die from a preventable condition; smart and thoughtful action needs to be taken. Our company; Fiduscript aims to make it easy for anyone in the United States (from law enforcement to worried parents; and everyone in between) to order Naloxone and have it delivered to their door seamlessly. I’d like to take a few moments to highlight some of the incredible things that happened to us this past year. It all started in January 2018; when I nervously pitched my idea to an audience of business students at the #1 ranked University of Chicago Booth School of Business. There; I met an inspiring; intelligent young physician that was a natural fit to collaborate and execute our mission. Shortly after; we reached out to a broader network of healthcare enthusiasts within the University of Chicago. We were able to recruit two other graduate students to join me from GPHAP. We submitted an application to the nationally recognized Social New Venture Challenge (SNVC) and Fiduscript was announced as a semi-finalist. The Social New Venture Challenge semi-finalists. Fiduscript team (May 2018) We learned a lot in the 10-week challenge about our business and from each other under the guidance of excellent teachers and mentors from the Chicago Booth community. In the end; we didn’t advance to the finals; however; we knew we had a viable business. Create an account to read the full story. The author made this story available to Medium members only.

北歐創業論壇SLUSH工作人員申請介紹 上篇,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write 北歐創業論壇SLUSH工作人員申請介紹 上篇 Wes Hsu · Follow Published in Wes Conference Review · 10 min read · Jan 1; 2019 23 SLUSH工作人員申請經驗與論壇參展評論。上半段著重申請流程與時間順序，以及工作現場的實際經歷與反思。下半段則是與參展團體在會場互動的分享和會後的行程建議。合計兩篇總共九千字的文章。 [前情提要] 對於SLUSH這個活動已經聽過多年，最早是在台灣的科技雜誌上翻過幾篇報導，不過當時沒有想過在數年後能進入會場親身體驗那幾頁光彩奪目的敘述。在2018年經歷赫爾辛基場的這段旅程後想要分享給更多的朋友，希望對創業、科技或是志工有興趣的朋友能有機會來參與這場盛會。 北歐創業論壇SLUSH主要演講舞台之一的創辦人舞台(Founder Stage) [時間表] 以下先給大家一個訊息公布的時間表，希望讓第一次申請工作人員的朋友，能降低每天更新信箱郵件匣的憂慮。 8/1 線上申請系統開放 8/6 註冊帳戶提交申請 10/7 線上報名系統截止 10/15 收到第一封組長的來信，詢問可行的Skype面試時間。 10/16 線上面試，並加入小組的WhatsApp群組。收到官方邀請信。 11/9 官方公布合作青年旅館、臉書大會資訊社團與住宿互助社團 11/14 第一封工作人員內部通訊信(Newsletter) 11/17 工作人員培訓日(可選擇參加)，於芬蘭埃斯波(Espoo)。 11/20 公布官方周邊活動(Side Events)。小組的第一次線上會議。 11/24 第二封工作人員內部通訊信，包含工作手冊。 11/27 第三封工作人員內部通訊信，會前訓練注意事項。 12/1 第四封工作人員內部通訊信，大會手機版APP釋出。 12/3 會前訓練與工作人員肖像照拍攝。 12/4 正式會期第一日。 12/5 正式會期第二日。 12/6 芬蘭獨立日。 12/7 國際志工周的新創團隊參訪。 12/8 志工限定會後派對 [申請步驟] 線上申請系統的資料填寫並不複雜，我相信對大多數的大學生半個小時即可完成，第一頁的基本資料包含，工作經驗與技能、先前志工經驗、語言技能與程度(並不需要附上檢定證明)、教育程度(選填)、專業領域(選填)、有興趣的大會主題(至多選擇三項)，接著，下個頁面是工作人員的申請，可以在三十多個小組選擇自己有興趣申請的團隊加入，我認為申請者需要事先對各組的工作內容有初步了解再勾選，因為這決定會期的工作排班與參展時間，如果排班與想聽的講座時間衝突，會降低預期的與會收穫，因此在下面我舉一些小組的工作性質，提供大家選填志願的參考。此外的問題還有是否願意擔任小組組長、是否能參加十一月的會前訓練、是否需要會期間的住宿等，最後最重要的是自我介紹與參展動機，沒有字數限制，我只用不到一百字表達自己的熱情以及對於會議的高度興趣，就通過了第一階段的書面審查。 超過三十種的工作性質小組，內部其實會在按造數字分成一組約十人，將兩千四百多位志工分配進每個小單位。以下是我在會場有接觸到的志工，因此以他們的工作經驗分享作介紹。 名牌印製小組(Badge Claim Team): 對於講者(Speaker)、與會者(Attendee)、投資者(Investor)與新創團隊(Startup)，進入主會場或是周邊活動前，都需要提供身分證或是護照以領取名牌與活動手環，才能參與後續的活動，工作地點除了會場外，可能會到市區購物中心或是餐館酒吧等周邊場地，工作環境因為需要印表機及筆電，能在溫暖的室內輪班。 講者接待小組(Slush Buddies Team): 需要與講者頻繁信件往來，安排接機或是市區交通的協助，是個很好的機會能與台上的產業先驅近距離接觸，如果講者在會後提前離開，志工在會期的工作量與時間並不長。 餐飲服務小組(Catering Team): 會場四處都設有杯水服務站，甚至可以選擇氣泡水，而遞水的工作就是由他們負責。對於想聽演講與參展的朋友並不理想，因為值班時間大多在會期進行時間。 衣帽間服務小組(Cloakroom Team): 會場的南北出口各設有衣帽架的大型場地，負責對於大衣以及背包標號存放與送回的工作，標籤是使用回收的纖維再製，是主辦方所講求的永續選擇。 派對支援小組(Parties Team): 在派對的飲品攤位負責取酒與開瓶的工作，活動結束後也一同回收瓶罐。其他組別也有負責檢查活動手環及發放酒券等工作。 周邊商品小組(Store Team)的工作地點與官方服飾 周邊商品小組(Store Team): 會場一隅有官方的服飾如連帽長袖或是提袋與毛帽等商品，在紫外燈的照射下散發螢光，負責介紹產品特色與挑選尺寸。 永續回收小組(Sustainability Team): 現場設置大量的分類回收桶，永續志工的工作是引導與會者投入正確的桶子，一個我認為相當辛苦的職位。 志工區域小組(Volunteer Area Team): 在志工休息區有零食、水果、咖啡與氣泡飲料等簡單的食物可以領取，補貨與清潔桌面的工作是他們所執行。 第二階段的線上面試也不需要給自己太大的壓力，我自身的經驗是約十分鐘的談話，而話題涵蓋基本的自我介紹以及對於工作的想像與期待只占了一半，剩下的一半其實是組長簡介接下來一個多月的工作行程安排，還有確認組員能夠配合的時間。若是與自身預期有落差，都可以向組長提出，組員的調動是非常正常而且頻繁的。我雖然在十月就進入通訊群組，但直到十一月中我們這組的名單才更改成活動當天所呈現的人員。也因此，在收到罐頭拒絕信的當下並不要太氣餒，我有其他台灣志工朋友的經驗是11/9當天收到官方拒絕信後，約一周後的11/15又接到錄取通知信，我想是部分小組有組員退出，因此候補上先前刷掉的人選。 SLUSH 2018 工作人員大合照，圖片取自官方社群軟體 Instagram 小結申請成功的要素，除了己身的服務熱忱外，我認為申請的時間也是一個考量的因素，高達兩千四百人的志工團隊，篩選的流程難以等到報名截止後才開始，提前送出申請使得更多的時間讓小組組長選入自己的組別。而我這次在系統開放第一周即提交申請，比起截止日提早了兩個月，希望有興趣的大家在明年也能在時間上取得一點申請優勢。 [我所分配的工作] 很幸運的我被選入派對支援小組，更讓其他志工羨慕的是我們這組的排班時間是在會期前一天與會期第一天的晚上時段，下午五點到凌晨三點的時間。因此在主場館的講座時間能夠讓我們自由運用，會期第二天的會後派對也不需要值班，可以跟與會者一樣享受到會場的獨特氣氛。此外工作地點與內容與其他派對支援組別並不太一樣，我們的工作場所都在市區的酒吧餐館，也不需要開瓶開罐遞飲料，而主要是查對訪客的邀請名單。組內總共有九個成員，一半都是芬蘭當地的學生，其餘來自國家有瑞典、印度、印尼與奈及利亞，不過大多目前都在北歐念書或是待業。 創辦人大街(Founders Street; Kalevankatu)的官方周邊活動聚集點 第一天的工作地點是在市區的創辦人大街(Founders Street; Kalevankatu)，街道兩旁餐館與酒吧林立，為了讓活動地點更加醒目，路中央有設置一個透明的管狀小空間，裡面有幾個小吧檯，幾盞強烈的暖氣燈，最重要的是DJ台，不過音響其實是置於室外，也就是在大街上撥放著派對樂曲，讓與會者路過街道小巷時不會錯過，同時我們也看到很多長者在經過音響時面帶嫌惡摀著耳朵快步通過。派對活動開始前，我們在名叫老學生浩室(Old student House)的展演舞台負責場佈如掛布條及綁彩帶等簡單工作，專業的燈光調控與環境音響系統則是其他廠商所包辦。活動期間，我們負責查對邀請名單，並發予特製單向手環，讓受邀訪客可以自由進出二樓貴賓休息室。同時在場地輪班的志工還有名牌印製小組，相比之下，他們的工作量比我們大的多。第一天排班時間較短，在午夜十二點前下崗，這時身上的志工名牌基本上是各個派對的通行證，但事實上我們都是滑開手機找尋最近一班開往青旅的巴士，然後刷著主辦單位發的交通卡快速返家，為了第一天會期上午十點的開幕表演。 第二天的工作地點則換到了市區外圍Kallio區的知名複合式酒吧，內部有三個主要的舞池還有一個樂團表演的舞台，而因為是邀請限定的派對，我們的工作比昨天繁重的多，需要一一查對訪客的名牌或是身分證，從兩千多個受邀賓客表單中尋找對應名字，而因為場地限制，我們的檢查點設在室外的棚架座位區，也就是在芬蘭十二月天與凜冽寒風併肩工作。 從十點開始訪客陸續湧入，最理想的查對情境是出示的名牌完全符合表單上的名字與身份，如講者、與會者或是投資者，次之的是出示身分證或是其他姓名的證明，最複雜的情況是輸入各種名字反覆搜尋之後，仍然無法顯示搜尋結果。若是第一個條件成立，我們接著引導賓客前往衣帽間並領取活動限定的單向手環，附加一個大大的微笑歡迎他們的到來；若是最後一種情況發生，往往需要解釋這個派對的性質，而我們也常得到不下十種的原因回覆，像是”我朋友轉寄了活動邀請”、”我公司的執行長已經進去派對場地等我們了”，或是”我代替有事無法前往的朋友來參加等等”。不過這些都不及無法勸阻，繼續在入口棚子下徘徊的群眾，此時與我們一起排班的近十位警衛工作量即呈現指數上升，需要清楚指明出口的方向來減緩壅塞的人流壓力。一直到凌晨兩點排隊人潮大幅減少，先前進場的賓客也漸漸離場，我們才結束這晚的值班任務。 過程中也遇到許多不耐煩的客人越過排隊隊伍，在柵欄前大聲嚷嚷，稱自己是受邀貴賓，要求快速通關的閘門，但後果可想而知，一樣被警衛請到隊伍最後面重新排隊。我也甚至遇過不在名單上的投資客，想要使用眼神脅迫施壓，甚至指著我的志工名牌，面帶不悅得說我記住你了之類的威脅語句，並在場外來回踱步了兩三圈才離去。雖然當下會猶豫自己到底要得罪幾十位北歐創業圈的投資客，但在一兩周後回想這些小顛簸，我認為只敢對付底層第一線工作人員的人格特質，也不適合成為未來的合作夥伴或是股東對象，對於當晚的試圖衝撞進入派對的人士也就少了一點愧疚感。與志工合作的警衛們，都是受過專業訓練、身著制服，可靠可信賴的彪形夥伴，必要時也建議我們遇到不符合名單的客人時只要舉手就好，他們會幫我們處理後續的解釋等工作，是我們特別感謝的搭檔，也是整場活動重要的工作之一。 [文章中段] SLUSH 主場館 Messukeskus 的入口通道 以上是志工申請的步驟介紹與一些心得，我會在下一篇繼續介紹會場的演講與體驗，還有在赫爾辛基的參訪與行程安排，希望大家能在北歐的寒冬中度過暖暖充實的一周。北歐創業論壇SLUSH工作人員申請介紹 下篇。 北歐創業論壇SLUSH工作人員申請介紹 下篇 前面介紹完志工申請的步驟，下篇將接續我在會場中遇到的參展攤位，以及當地的一周行程安排，其中還包含芬蘭獨立日與新創團隊工作環境的參訪。最後還有工作人員專屬的派對分享，如果還沒瀏覽上篇的讀者可以點擊下方連結。北歐創業論壇SLUSH工作人員申請介… medium.com Sign up to discover human stories that deepen your understanding of the world.

InvenTech Our mission is to empower people with the ability to do more with technology. I joined an amazingly fast-growing startup company at the Obafemi Awolowo University; called InvenTech. We are a team of hardware; software and business engineers were we are building a web-based drag and drop platform that gives you a new way to program; control and monitor microcontrollers using IoT at its core and also we have a hardware product called InventOne board( a microcontroller that’s made in Nigeria by Nigerians). I bet you it’s better than other Micro-controllers out there. We had a lot of achievements this year as a company. We got the opportunity to exhibit and showcase our products at Techpoint Inspired; the largest tech conference in West Africa in May; with close to over 1000 tech experts and enthusiasts coming to check out our platform. It was really overwhelming seeing how people came around to our stand loving what we’ve built. Later we go interviewed and featured by Techpoint crew because they also loved our products. Weeks later; we got an invite by HP Africa courtesy SV-NED inc and we had the chance to pitch our platform to HP Africa Top executives. We also had a training seminar at the Electrical and Electronics Department; OAU were Professors; Lecturers; and students came to learn more about our invention and learnt how to use it.

Online Communities — Part 2: Prerequisites; scaling; and some great examples.,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write Online Communities — Part 2: Prerequisites; scaling; and some great examples. Eylon Aviv · Follow Published in DataDrivenInvestor · 8 min read · Jan 1; 2019 588 In the previous article; we talked about what is a community. But just like Rome; or any other city for that matter; communities are not built in a day. It’s a process that usually requires a hard; concentrated; and extended effort from a single or a small group of people. The keys to a successful community Have you ever wondered why some communities succeed long-term and some don’t; why do they break and what makes people leave them? I’ve researched what are some characteristics and prerequisites for creating successful online communities. There are many categories and subcategories and a lot of literature. Stan Garfield; the legendary Community evangelist has done extensive research on this and according to him; these are 3 keys to communities of practice. A compelling topic: The members and potential members must be passionate about the subject for collaboration; and it must be relevant to their work. A critical mass of members: You usually need at least 100 members; with 200 being a better target. See this related discussion thread (twitter). A committed leader: The community leader should know the subject; have the energy for stimulating collaboration; have sufficient time to devote to leadership; and then regularly spend time increasing membership; lining up speakers; hosting calls and meetings; asking and answering questions; and posting information which is useful to the members. The first two points are clear — you need a common topic of interest that the members of the community share; and you need enough people to create that community. Let's focus on the third. Communities require a leader; there is no way for a community to form without one or a few leaders that invest time and effort into building it; creating content; and setting the path and values for the community and its future members. Also; social media seems to have allowed us to surpass Dunbar’s number of up to 200 stable relationships; or has it? When the scale starts breaking What happens if/when the community grows? Big communities can become a source of power — from organizing movements of change to purchasing power and buying syndicates; all the way to buying a castle together. Yes I got spiderman in here The Leader or the person who started the community now finds himself with more and more power. More often than not the leader realizes his power — “I built this community; this community is mine; and I decide what happens to it.” But wait; how can one person own the community; how can one person decide? What about joint ownership; isn’t that community? As communities grow; their purpose and objective grow with them. Pivots and shifts in the direction of the community can be quite drastic from where the community started from. What happens when there’s a disagreement between the community members and the leader regarding these shifts? Let's play a thought experiment. Tomorrow; your community present you with a signed petition of over 60% members. There; they request you to relinquish your admin-ship and pass the baton to someone else. Will you do as they request; or stick to your guns? What about other cases where the leader no longer serves the community or forces his agenda. Maybe he grew tired of the community and doesn’t want to manage it anymore. Or maybe he decides to monetize it. From running ads at the expense of the members; silencing people who think differently or oppose them; and all the way to selling the group. As Cyndi Lauper taught us back in the 80s; Dan Ariely at Burning man; or countless articles; songs; and experiments — we change when faced with money. Money changes everything Another thought experiment — Someone offers you a million dollars to sell your community; to use at their discretion. This is not ‘never work again in your life money’ but it is a lump sum. Some of you are community managers; right? What would you do? (If you decide to give it to your community of 10;000 members each will get $100) Communities are dependent on their leaders to run them justly and not to succumb to temptations of personal gain — power; money; or status. In the process of scaling online communities; the leaders are the single point of failure. How do you get past this hurdle? What are examples of communities and online communities that have really managed to grow; thrive; and scale? How did the leaders of the community who are essential to its formation acted? What did they do differently? Successful communities To get a clue lets explore some of the successful communities that have survived the tests of time. Wikipedia On October 27th; 2001; Jimmy Wales created Wikipedia; which will later become the first online distributed community. These are statements of principles; emphasizing openness; open source; and neutral point of view which have guided the Wikipedia community over the years. Imagine a world in which every single human being can freely share in the sum of all knowledge. that’s our commitment. — Wikimedia foundation Satement One of those principals is: Newcomers are always to be welcomed. There must be no cabal; there must be no elites; there must be no hierarchy or structure which gets in the way of this openness to newcomers …. so that people are automatically given full privileges once they have been around the community for a very short period of time.” Anyone is welcome to join and after a short process; you are an equal member and contributor in the community. — Joint Ownership. Wikipedia is now in the top #5 most visited websites in the world; with Google; Youtube; Facebook; and Baidu preceding it —consequently; these are some of the richest companies in the world; led by the richest entrepreneurs. Jimmy has got to be one of the richest people in the world right? Well no; his net worth is estimated at a bit over $1 Million. As some of you may know Wikipedia is non-profit; it’s run by the community; for the community. Had it been for profit; had there been a personal incentive to build Jimmy Wales’ company? Do you think people would contribute to Wikipedia? To someone else’s wealth? I think Jimmy realized that the only way for Wikipedia to fulfill it’s potential and become the sum of all knowledge it has to be a true community; jointly owned by its users and free of any personal gain. Wikipedia is first and foremost an effort to create and distribute a free encyclopedia of the highest possible quality to every single person on the planet in their own language. Asking whether the community comes before or after this goal is really asking the wrong question: the entire purpose of the community is precisely this goal . — Jimmy “Jimbo” Wales Bitcoin Bitcoin is a social phenomenon backed by mathematics. I don’t think anyone can argue about the strength of the Bitcoin community; after more than 330 obituaries and counting; it still exists and continues to create headlines. The stronger the social connections in that community; the stronger Bitcoin will be. Why are people a part of the Bitcoin community? On the surface; it’s speculation and monetary gain. People buy bitcoin because they speculate that it will go up in value. But a lot of those; myself included; stayed for more than that. From Austrian economic views; the excessive power of banks; and economic equality. The fundamentals of Bitcoin are exactly the same of a Community — Joint ownership enforced by the protocol. Satoshi Nakamoto designed a system that assumes selfish behavior and ensures that the only way to move forward is through collaboration and participation. He also understood that If he really wants Bitcoin to scale and fulfill its potential; which will be uncovered in the coming years; he has to remove himself from it. Perhaps taking lessons from Jimmy and Wikipedia. The bitcoin whitepaper — By Satoshi Nakamoto; October 31st; 2008 About a year ago; Satoshi Nakamoto was ranked among the 50 richest people in the world as noted Quartz . Oh man; could you imagine? Immeasurable wealth at the palm of your hands; and yet we don’t know who he is and none of his funds have been moved; Satoshi; just like Jimmy; gave up personal gain for the success of the community. Rajneeshpuram In the early 1980s followers of who would later be named Osho; erected a full city that housed over 7;000 people; an airport; hotel; and even an artificial lake. Check out the Netflix documentary — Wild wild country I can’t recommend it enough. It really shows what a community can build and do if they have a shared goal/something in common and they feel joint ownership. By all measures; Rajneeshpuram was a successful community that accomplished incredible deeds. Eventually; though; both leaders; Shiela and Bhagwan; became corrupt; stopped serving their community and instead lead it to pursue their personal interests; and thus the community broke down. Such is the fate of communities with powerful leaders that fall for personal incentives. There are many other examples which I did not include. For example; the fundamentals of religion are also based on such things. But they are piled with layers of personal interest and gain which have tainted the base layer of spirituality; which I think is an important part of the human experience. To conclude While leaders are vital to the formation of the community if the community is to scale and reach its potential that leader(s) has to remove himself from omnipotence; forfeit power; and allow the community to take charge. When there is no single point of authority; power; or ownership when members of the community feel equal and the power to influence the community through action; contribution; and collaboration; that is a true community. With the connection opportunities of the internet such decentralized communities; like Wikipedia and Bitcoin; can grow into world-changing movements; improving the lives of their participants; contributors; and even ‘lurkers’ — most people just use Wikipedia; they don’t contribute. What other communities can be built? The possibilities are endless and our imagination is the only limit. In the next part… We will talk about why does this happen; anthropologically and philosophically. Why do positions of power change human behavior; and what can we do to change that? The clue lies in the last of the five good emperors; Marcus Aurelius; a personal exemplar of mine. The most powerful person during his time and yet a just and righteous leader.

Robot Missions Top 10 Moments from 2018,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write Robot Missions Top 10 Moments from 2018 Erin RobotGrrl · Follow Published in RobotMissions · 11 min read · Jan 1; 2019 2 Robot Missions Season Finale Field Test on Westboro Beach; Ottawa; Canada (September 2018) Hello robot friends! It has been an action packed year for Robot Missions to say the least! From meeting Prime Minister Justin Trudeau; to having 100 participants be part of our Season Finale Field Test; to the progress on the robots functioning autonomously and with artificial intelligence. This will be a year to remember. Not only in the progress made; but in the ways we witnessed the community rally together to help support our cause and make the vision a reality. What we accomplished this year was made possible in large part because of the support of the community. Spring time testing with the robots on Westboro Beach (Photo by Andrea Tomkins; April; 2018) I’ve always envisioned Robot Missions as a huge mountain that one desires to reach the summit of. Since the journey is a crucial part of the adventure; then the only legitimate way to reach the peak is to just keep climbing upwards. And we’ve made a few steps forward this year. At this vantage point; it is a privilege to see the steps that helped us reach this far. Going through the year might not have felt successful at times — perhaps more like drowning during portions of it. By partially emerging to take pause and look back; it’s evident that this year we’ve made a significant leap forwards in the big dream of Robot Missions. Moving Bowie out of the water; it was OK (May or June; 2018) Of course; there were mistakes and missteps made along the way. Undoubtedly; there were also sad moments this year. We will learn from these and strive to improve in 2019. We’re fortunate that it was difficult to narrow down this list to only 10 moments. With that said; here are the top 10 Robot Missions moments of 2018: MadeMill Artist in Residence at the Canada Science and Technology Museum — left to right: Will Fletcher; Tom Radford; Eric Chan aka eepmon; Erin Kennedy aka RobotGrrl; Petr Maur (Photo by Petr Maur — February 2018) 10. Artist in Residence at MadeMill Working on the robots to get them running for the Robo-Obstacle course! Inside of the Digital Media Lab at MadeMill (Photo by Petr Maur — February; 2018) This is what really spring-boarded it all. Being able to work for three weeks on Robot Missions un-distracted at MadeMill allowed us to dream about what can be possible. At MadeMill; it was a one of its kind environment where you are surrounded with many cool resources in the form of fabrication tools and knowledgable experts. We learned more; and experimented with waterjet cutting metal pieces for the robot. Using this tech; we made wheels that were much bigger than what would have been feasible on our smaller 3D printer. Future roboticists enjoying the robo-obstacle course at the Canada Science and Technology Museum (Photo by Petr Maur — February 2018) The experience culminated in running a Robo-Obstacle course at the Canadian Science and Technology Museum; with two robots that were operational! Luckily from this three week experience; I was invited to join the team as an electronics designer. Without a doubt; this significantly changed the orbit of Robot Missions — opening many new amazing possibilities and opportunities. Incredibly thankful for this. Winning the 100th Awesome Foundation Ottawa award; presented at Shopify (April 2018) 9. Stakeholders; Demonstrations; Presentations! Engaging with stakeholders through demonstrations; presentations; and more — It’s such an honour when important people lend their time to hear about what we are working on with Robot Missions. Even more significant; is when that person helps champion your initiative. Kitchissippi Ward Councillor Jeff Leiper and Erin with Yellow Bowie and Original Bowie; in front of the Pod (Photo by Petr Maur — September 2018) One shining example of this was with Councillor Jeff Leiper; who helped with getting the approval for our initiative to take place on Westboro Beach in the summer; and joined in many times during the summer when we were working on the project and robots. We couldn’t have asked for a better person to help with this! Additional highlights include meeting Minister Kirsty Duncan; Minister Catherine McKenna; Mayor Jim Watson; winning an Awesome Foundation award; presenting at the Innovators and Entrepreneurs series at SDTC; being highlighted during the uOttawa Women in Tech event and meeting the VP of Amazon AWS; and more. Demonstration with Minister Kirsty Duncan at MadeMill (December 2018) Plus; a fond memory of when Megan Smith gave a shoutout to Robot Missions during her keynote at OCE Discovery. All of these give more awareness to Robot Missions; which helps us broaden our reach — so we very much appreciate it. Environmental Robotics BioBlitz Workshop at the Hackaday Superconference in Pasadena; CA (Photo by Bradley G — November; 2018) 8. Crowd-sourced robot in 48 hours Lenore Edman and Matt Borgatti helping assemble the crowd-sourced 3D printed Bowie robot at Hackaday Supercon! Thank you for your help! (November; 2018) To start off; we weren’t entirely sure that this would or would not be possible. For the Hackaday Supercon in Pasadena; CA; we asked attendees ahead of time if they have a 3D printer and if they could print some robot parts to replicate a Bowie robot. It was really amazing that there were people who were willing to contribute print time and filament to the build! On the Friday; the build started; and continued throughout Saturday. Time management could have probably been better. This was all leading up to the workshop; similar to a Field Test; which was on Sunday. Alex and her robot owl meets Erin and her robot Bowie! (November; 2018) With the help of volunteers at Supercon with assembling the robot; we were able to get the robot going just in the nick of time with 30 minutes to spare! The workshop; Environmental Robotics BioBlitz was attended by a dozen or so hardware hackers who are also interested in tackling environmental challenges. The Hackaday Supercon provided a great place to test this crowd-sourced build; and test the robot. Bowie was able to pick up a chip bag! A big thank you to everyone who helped out to make this possible! University of Ottawa Introduction to Engineering Design class in the super fancy learning crossroads classroom. This was the 2nd semester Robot Missions was a part of! (September 2018) 7. uOttawa Engineering Design class Hazmat Bowie group demonstrating their design at Design Day (November 2018) Working with the University of Ottawa introduction to engineering design class students for two semesters has been interesting! It’s really amazing to provide the robot as a platform to the students; and see what they would develop as modules to tackle an environmental challenge or to improve the capability of the robot. The groups that were able to do multiple prototype iterations in the semester developed functional modules. It was impressive for a first year class. Water sampler Bowie in action on the Ottawa River (April 2018) In the first semester one group decided to tackle water sampling with Bowie. The module they made was great; and functioned to collect three individual water samples. The following semester; one group decided to tackle the challenge of making Bowie into a water skimmer. They made an area for Bowie to ‘sit’ on a buoyant platform (which also used recycled 2L pop bottles). This shows that the students did build on each others work; as the project in the first semester could be used by the project in the second semester. The idea worked! These were just two of the several interesting projects that helped push the functionality forwards. Many thanks to University of Ottawa for helping the students collaborate with Robot Missions! Autonomous navigation testing — here Bowie is visually identifying the markers and following them (August 2018) 6. Technical achievements with robots 3D printed tank treads on the test robot (July 2018) There was a lot of work put in to coding the robots and upgrading them this season. We managed to have three robots working; each of them with their own specialty. We were able to get 3D printed tank treads rolling on the robot — though to our surprise they ended up working better just rolling on the sprockets! Paths in the sand — as created by a GPS + IMU navigation program (June 2018) For navigating autonomously; we encountered difficulties using the standard GPS + IMU approach on the sandy terrain. This meant it was necessary to change the approach! We went with using augmented reality markers; where the robot could visually detect the marker and navigate within a square. First working test of the image classification AI program on the robot! (July 2018) We got Tensorflow up and running on the Raspberry Pi; trained the dataset; and were able to get three sub-systems to talk to each other in order for the robot to successfully scoop when it detected debris. Wow! We had imagined this; and now this year an early version of it became reality. Also; who can forget when we modified Bowie to be able to apply lipstick?! Erin; Bowie; and the Canadian Space Agency Small Planetary Rover Platform at OCE Discovery (April 2018) 5. Field Test at a very cool special location This one is still secret; but you’ll hear about this in the new year! ;) The team in front of the Pod!

Left to right: Erin; Tick Tock Tom; Jason Alford (Photo by Trish K — May 2018) Deploying the Pod onto Westboro Beach was a dream come true. An off-grid solar powered work station to serve as the Robot Missions HQ during the summer. This was made possible thanks to prototypeD Team. They put in the hard work to make the design; construct it; and fit it up so it looked stellar on the interior. Thanks to them for allowing us to use the Pod and paint it purple. Bowie navigating with AR markers in front of the Pod by sunset (August 2018) The Pod was a beacon when we were on the beach. Folks on the beach would come up to ask if we were selling ice cream or surfboards? Nope. :D This is mission control centre to the beach cleaning robots! Painting first layer of primer on the Pod! Thanks to Cailey Petrenko; Jeff Leiper and Steven Shyaka (not in the photo) for helping (May 2018) Good times were had painting it purple (even Councillor Jeff Leiper stopped by to lend a hand and his painting expertise!); spray painting the designs; the installation; and working inside of it during the summer. We wish it was still here with us today. I miss it. It would have been cool to put lights on it for the holidays. The fond experiences of it on the beach and working on the robots inside keep its memory alive. Participants at the Season Finale Field Test on Westboro Beach! (Photo by Petr Maur — September 2018) 3. Season Finale Field Test Giving a tech demo of Yellow Bowie’s functionality (Photo by Petr Maur — September 2018) It was so humbling to see participants join us on a beautiful day for our season finale Field Test and celebrate the progress made during the summer. Considering the start of the season Field Test was in pouring rain (a handful of people did come out to this; which was amazing); this was a fitting finish! We had all three robots operating; did a few demonstrations of the AI; and discussed with people the progress made and what some of the current limitations are. Welcome! Briefing participants about the Bowie robots and what we have accomplished this summer (Photo by Petr Maur — September 2018) This was a blast; and thank you to everyone who joined in; it was wonderful to see folks come again who visited previously in the summer; and meet folks who were new to the initiative! Meeting Prime Minister Justin Trudeau at MadeMill in the Innovation Centre at Bayview Yards! (Photo by Petr Maur — April 2018) 2. Robot Demo to the Prime Minister Driving the robot! (Photo by Petr Maur — April 2018) Wow; this was such an honour to meet Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and share Robot Missions with him. During the demonstration; Yellow Bowie scooped up a crumpled paper ball on the floor (representing trash) and opened its lid to deposit it into the hopper. It was quite the feeling to see everyone applaud when this happened! Afterwards; the Prime Minister even drove the robot! Handing over the controls! (Photo by Petr Maur — April 2018) Hearing how he was aware that 3D printing was ubiquitous was fantastic. It is a great highlight; especially as an inventor; to have your project recognised. This helps introduce Robot Missions to a national stage now; and strengthens the recognition as an initiative. I personally don’t think I will forget this for a million years. Thank you to those who made this possible; namely MadeMill for featuring us. Engaging with participants at the Season Finale Field Test! Here Erin is talking with Beck Langstone; an amazing volunteer this summer! (Photo by Petr Maur — September 2018) 1. YOU! People learning about the robots during the Westboro Beach beach closer (September 2018) Participants; the team; people who helped with workshops and Field Tests; and valuable mentors and advisors. You’re the motivation that keeps us going. We’ve met many of you through the Field Tests this summer; and it has been a pleasure to share the robots with you (even when the robots were being difficult). One of the last Field Tests of the season (August 2018) It’s amazing when you get to hear tidbits of the initiative from other people — one we heard was that the robots on the beach was the ‘sensation of the summer’. I still can’t believe that at the Westboro Beach closing; we had people lining up to play with the robot! We used every last volt possible in the batteries that evening. :) Lovely sentiments were shared over Twitter throughout the summer! (June 2018) Hooray! One of the Field Tests at the start of the summer (April or May 2018) It really means a lot that the community enjoyed our project! We aim to make an impact in the community and the local environment with robots. The critical bit is all of you — and without; this would simply not be possible. As well; a personal big thank you to those who have been generous with their time to mentor and advise. Shoutout to my mentors Leah L; Chris B; Jason A; Olivia P; Andrew P; Brenda B — you’ve helped more than you would know. The learning opportunities have been tremendous and have been endowed through your guidance. Thank you!! A look at some of the garbage Bowie collects on a typical Field Test — except for the dentures of course! (July 2018) Bonus — Weirdest item Bowie collected: half of a pair of dentures! Erin with Original Bowie. Thanks for making 2018 an amazing year. Check out these new wheels! :) (Photo by Petr Maur — December 2018) We’re still wrapping up some items from 2018; as the to-do list is still quite long… this includes an avalanche of email replies and thank you notes to do (sorry). It was really a wildly interesting year; though this list only gives look at one side; there were many learning opportunities along the way. Again; thank you to everyone who helped make this year a success! We’re looking forward to what we will be doing in 2019; though it might be different.

Have Data; Want Impact,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write Have Data; Want Impact Ryan den Rooijen · Follow 2 min read · Jan 1; 2019 -- 1 Organisations and individuals alike are realising that data — their data — has value. While data literacy has a long way to go; this is an important first step. Judicious use of analytics can have a significant positive impact on individuals’ lives: think of better energy management; increased financial security; and improved medical decisions; to name just a few. On a societal level it can help mitigate environmental degradation; improve allocation of tax revenues; and define better policies and treaties; increasing overall happiness; transparency; and welfare. Analytics can simplify complexity. Agriculture is one area where analytics can add a lot of value. Photo by Marco Verch. If you’re wondering why it doesn’t feel like these benefits are being realised; well; you’re not the only one. There are likely two factors at play here. Firstly; we have difficulty at times recognising progress; instead amplifying the negative news while sidelining positive developments. If you’re interested in overcoming this bias I’d recommend Factfulness; the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Annual Letters; and the New York Times’ Week in Good News. The second factor is simpler: humans aren’t doing a great job yet at unlocking the promise of data; analytics; and AI. In certain areas we have seen an almost magical level of progress; e.g. machine translation and complex board games. However; in others we are only in our infancy; and many organisations are not realising the value they could; both due to technical and behavioural hurdles. It can be difficult for organisations to change track. Photo by Tuncay Coskun. The question therefore is this: how can we move from simply having data to using it to deliver positive impact; and reducing the time it takes us to do so? I’m fortunate to have benefited greatly from my peers’ experiences; and I’m aiming to return the favour by sharing some of mine; starting this year. I’ll look to cover topics such as the data analytics ecosystem; hackathons & design thinking; practical AI applications; diversity & talent development; and organisational design. Suggestions or questions are always very welcome. May I end by wishing you a happy; healthy; and prosperous New Year! — Ryan Sign up to discover human stories that deepen your understanding of the world. Free Distraction-free reading. No ads.

Netflix Pulls Subscriptions from iOS Bypassing Apple Tax,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write Netflix Pulls Subscriptions from iOS Bypassing Apple Tax Glen Whillier · Follow Published in DataDrivenInvestor · 2 min read · Jan 2; 2019 -- 1 Image Credit: Knau In early 2018 Netflix pulled the option to subscribe to their service through the Google Play store in order to bypass the share that Google takes of subscriptions. The decision left many assuming that the same fate would await their iOS app and indeed as 2018 ended so to did the option of subscribing to Netflix through the Apple App Store. “We no longer support iTunes as a method of payment for new members;” a Netflix spokesperson told VentureBeat. This comes after many developers have voiced their upset over the percentage both Apple and Google take of any in-app purchase. Both companies used to take 30% but in more recent years cut that figure to 15%. Still tensions have remained high between developers and the two tech giants. Netflix isn’t the first company to do this; it’s one of many. Spotify pulled the option to subscribe in-app on iOS. Amazon limits movie and tv-show rentals through Prime Video to its website; Purchasing Kindle books isn’t available through their Kindle app either. Epic Games opted to release Fortnite on Android purposely not on the Google Play store to avoid Google taking a cut on in-game purchases. So just how much are companies like Apple and Google profiting off of these subscriptions? Netflix on iOS was grossing approximately $2.4 million a day in 2018; Apple’s cut would be around $700;000 of that figure. According to Sensor Tower; to date Netflix has generated $1.5 billion in in-app subscriptions; meaning Apple took home a comfortable $450 million+. It’s not entirely surprising why these companies are opting for the less user-friendly options and it also makes you wonder whether any other apps on the top-grossing list will consider making the jump.

The ABC of Tech You Must Know in 2019,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write Photo credit: Getty Images The ABC of Tech You Must Know in 2019 AI; blockchain; and community — in the new year; it is time to become exponential-tech literate. Tim Leberecht · Follow Published in Predict · 7 min read · Jan 1; 2019 -- When I read about the tech trend predictions for 2019; I feel a strong sense of déjà vu. So many of them sound exactly like the future we envisioned five years ago. Big data is big business. AI is the new electricity; and smart machine learning algorithms will empower consumers; personalize their experience; and enable better decision-making. Self-driving vehicles will make mobility safer and more energy-efficient. Automation will cost jobs but also free many of us to pursue work that is purposeful and fulfilling. “Moonshot thinking;” combined with a Silicon Valley-style fail-fast culture; is the panacea to transforming organizations and entire societies. Human-centered design is the key to doing this in the most humane fashion. And eventually transhumanism will merge human and machine anyway and produce performances at unprecedented level; including achieving immortality. Sound familiar? This future fatigue is not the fault of futurists–they are just reading the tea leaves in their cups. But obviously; the future is not just unevenly distributed; it is also taking a really long time to arrive. Incrementalism is the new disruption; and pragmatism the new moonshot. In this spirit; here are three tech trends that are not groundbreaking but may make or break your business in 2019. If you aren’t yet; this will be the year in which you ought to become exponential-tech-literate. Here’s the new ABC that you must master: A for “AI goes enterprise” By 2030; AI is projected to generate an estimated $13 trillion of GDP growth. In 2019; AI is going to penetrate the enterprise as an indispensable; mission-critical capability. The question is no longer; what tasks do you perform with AI but which tasks do you not? Supporting this line of thinking; a recently published research report by the MIT Sloan Management Review and The Boston Consulting Group (BCG) claims that AI is “becoming real”– advanced by a cohort of Fortune 500 firms beyond the usual AI-alphas Alphabet; Baidu; Facebook; and Microsoft. While many firms have dipped their toes in AI and recognized it as a key strategic challenge; only a few have actually devised; let alone implemented; a comprehensive AI strategy. Among them are Chevron; Mayo Clinic; and Pfizer. Identified as “pioneers” by the study; these firms were early adopters of AI; and they are now doubling down on their investment and seeking to scale it beyond sporadic pilots and point solutions. Ninety percent of these pioneers report they have a strategy in place already. What’s even more interesting is that 72 percent of them expect AI applications to primarily deliver revenue increases in the next five years; as opposed to mere efficiency gains. This means that AI will no longer be limited to just optimizing operations but is driving entire new business models. Emulating these pioneers; it might be time for you; too; to “become real” about AI by moving beyond process optimization. Armed with growing AI acumen; ask yourself: how would you radically re-design your business model from scratch today? Andrew Ng; the Chairman and CEO of Landing AI and former head of the Google Brain team and the Baidu AI Group; provides some helpful guidance in his new AI Transformation Playbook. He suggests forming an internal AI team that spans different business functions. Further; he advises companies to diversify their AI investment by creating multiple AI assets while making sure they all present an industry-specific advantage rather than merely a broad operational capability. Finally; he reminds us of the “virtuous cycle of AI” when designing AI-driven activities: more data -> better product -> more users -> more data -> better product; and so on. Simply put: an effective AI strategy is always an effective data strategy. B for “Blockchain is not going away” When will Blockchain finally deliver on its grand promise? Well; how about 2019?! The past two years saw a roller coaster ride for cryptocurrencies; starting with a breathtaking value increase of 3;252 percent in 2017 and a drop of 60 percent in crypto market value in 2018. Last December; the price of Bitcoin was $19;783; today it is $3;810 (the other two main cryptocurrencies; Ethereum; Litecoin; also dropped significantly). With its retail transactions declining rapidly; the most prominent of these currencies; Bitcoin; may now go into the annals of digital history as the Friendster (remember?) of crypto. But some say this crypto-winter may actually pave the way for different; more sophisticated blockchain applications. Shermin Voshmgir; co-founder of BlockchainHub; director of the Institute of Cryptoeconomics in Vienna; and author of an upcoming book on Blockchain; told me bullishly that this will be the year when Blockchain will grow up beyond Bitcoin and enable a whole new economy: the token economy. She believes that Bitcoin; despite its ultimate decline; has pioneered an operating system for “a new type of economy where is has become feasible for everyone to issue their own purpose-oriented token.” Indeed; tokens may create new marketplaces and new incentives to change or exhibit certain behaviors; such as planting trees instead of cutting them by mining “tree tokens” or saving CO2 emissions by biking instead of using the car through mining “Co2 tokens.” Some of these new tokens die on the vine (including; not surprisingly; Kodak’s). But still; as of today; 2;068 cryptocurrencies were listed on coinmarketcap. Countries such as Venezuela or cities such as Dubai or Lubljana have begun to create their own tokens as an exchange system to foster citizenship and virtual currency for tourists; and others including Berkeley; CA are expected to follow suit. Even soccer clubs such as Newcastle United are considering launching initial coin offerings. Blockchain is also serving as operating system for some transactions that are; although legalized in Canada and some US states; not performed by banks; which is why; for example; a formidable “alternate cannabis token economy” has emerged. Furthermore; applications such as BailBloc demonstrate how blockchain can be used for good by inviting users to donate their spare computer processing power to create a cryptocurrency named Monero. At the end of every month; the service exchanges Monero for US dollars and donates the earnings to one of the bail funds in the National Bail Fund Network. The transparency and mutual trust that blockchain provides are also perfectly suited for more effective supply chain management; blockchain expert Mark van Rijmenam argues; and he predicts in 2019 supply chains will be the first major enterprise use of blockchain. The revolutionary potential of blockchain is that it assigns and captures value for activities that have previously not been recognized as valuable or have lacked a transparent marketplace. Unlike the average consumer-investor; companies have not seized to pay attention. Consequently; blockchain will be one of the predominant themes at the upcoming World Economic Forum at the end of January; in the official program but even more so at the often more cutting-edge fringe events; from Davos BlockBase to Digital Davos. So where do you start? Ask yourself these questions: are there activities undertaken by colleagues or in your company’s ecosystem that constitute value that is not captured yet? If so; what kind of token can you launch that is linked to a real product; and how can you harness the token economics in your favor? C for “Community is making technology come home” Technology is not only increasingly social technology (using network effects); it is also a social activity. To adopt the new knowledge–the A and the B–and hone it in your organizations; community of practice is key. As Edward D. Hess and Kaz Gozdz contend; in the knowledge economy any successful organization will become a community–a “community of hyper-learners;” “a group of like-minded others of similar values and purpose.” Indeed; community motivates us to learn; creates a common striving (competition for respect among peers); and gives us a sense of belonging; a stable vantage point from which to observe and make sense of the fast-changing digital disruptions we’re all confronted with. No wonder new; alternative communal spaces are booming; from co-working to co-living to co-learning. Studies have shown that these spaces provide not only a sense of belonging; but also increase self-confidence. Combine these spaces with social learning and tech; and you have a winner. Labs; Meetups; and Basecamps are on the rise. Harvard Business School runs a Tech Club; and companies have begun to establish incubators embedded in vibrant urban communities (e.g. Daimler Trucks with its forthcoming Tech & Data Hub in the up-and-coming digital ecosystem of Lisbon) to pool knowledge and practitioners and lower the social barriers to skill acquisition. No longer can a single expert hold all the wisdom or connect all the dots alone. Peer exchange and critical community discourse are crucial for not only accessing but internalizing new knowledge and skills. Moreover; community rituals can help build the kind of muscle memory that initiates and sustains behavior change. In addition; communities are emerging that cater to the need to embrace new tech while also catering to our full selves through meditation; yoga; mindfulness; or other forms of conscious living. Take the co-living community The Assemblage in New York; that offers community; professional learning; and personal growth all at once. Or consider The Learning Hotel; one of Tablet Hotel Magazine’s visions for the “hotels of tomorrow;” a not-yet-realized concept that would tap into the collective wisdom of its guests by curating and gathering them in a meaningful way. When it comes to tech literacy; the intersection of hospitality; experience economy; and social learning is a space to watch. Community is not just the oldest human technology; it is also the enabler of essential human qualities: our ability to imagine alternate worlds through gatherings and stories. More than ever; every effort to strengthen innovation and drive transformation will need to foster these inherently social traits. This is why; as part of their AI strategy; companies should hone their workers’ artistic intelligence and offer art classes. For every pilot project in blockchain; they should treat their employees for a night out at cooking school. Without the C; the A and B are nothing. In 2019; even the most exponential technology won’t be going anywhere if it’s not coming home. This article was first published on Inc.com.

Venture Engagement Program: Winter 2018 Cohort Statistics,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write Venture Engagement Program: Winter 2018 Cohort Statistics Columbia Venture Community · Follow 6 min read · Jan 2; 2019 50 In November 2018; we launched the first pilot of our Venture Engagement Program; or VEP for short. VEP was designed to connect startups led by Columbia alumni with Venture Capitalists and Serial Entrepreneurs; in order for founders to receive funding and mentorship for their startup. While our Investment Committee completes the review process; we are excited to share some data about this winter’s cohort. Note: If you applied to this year’s winter cohort; please expect to receive notification about the status of your application over email in the next 2 weeks. Summary Average number of co-founders per startup: 2.09 Most common school represented: Columbia Business School (36%) Primary business location: Near NYC or in multiple locations Most common industries: E-Commerce; HealthTech; FinTech; and SaaS; representing over 65% of applicants Prior investments: 39% of startups have had 0 prior investments Of those that raised; average amount invested: $608;000 Average additional investment sought: $1;105;000 Startups seeking $1M+: 21% 1) Startups who applied had an average of 2.09 co-founders. In startups; it is not uncommon to have small founding teams: Startups; especially early stage; are less likely to have enough cash to pay for full-time employees. Co-founders are likely to go months with low or sometimes no form of compensation (Mission). Acknowledging this; CVC and our partner organizations should strive to offer additional resources to help startup founders who may not have the ability to hire or pay themselves. We were curious to research the optimal number of co-founders for an early-stage startup. We found this article in 2007; suggesting 2.09. More recently; Ali Tamaseb wrote in 2018 that 20% of all billion-dollar startups since 2005 had a solo founder; and more than 60% had only 2 or 3 co-founders. 2) 36% of co-founders attended Columbia Business School. Includes applicants who attended multiple programs. Excludes 13% of co-founders; who did not attend Columbia and applied for the Program with a Columbia-affiliated co-founder. We were not surprised by this: Entrepreneurship is a common path for Business School alumni. Students who preemptively decide to pursue entrepreneurship prior to enrolling in their program may also form a self-selecting sample who actively seek resources; such as Columbia Venture Community; to help build their startup. Our marketing may have also skewed towards Business School alumni; as many of CVC’s organizational partners have close ties to alumni and students at GSB. To this end; it is important that Columbia schools and organizations continue to develop entrepreneurial programming; both within and between their programs; in order to spur more connections between potential co-founders beyond select schools. We dug deeper; and saw the average number of years between co-founders who graduated from GSB was 1.6. This suggests that founders may be forming their early teams while in-school; or remain in touch with their classmates when pursuing their idea. In a future analysis; we would like to collect Cluster Information; to determine if GSB alumni are forming startups with classmates in or outside their Cluster. 3) 26% of startups had distributed teams. The distributions ranged from teams in 2 cities to teams in multiple continents; the most common was teams split between New York and Europe. We believe there may be many drivers here; but one idea we hunched was that certain key resources to a successful startup; such as human capital or access to a target market; may be more easily accessible or inexpensive abroad. 4) E-Commerce; HealthTech; FinTech; Consumer Tech; and SaaS represent 78% of startups who applied. We defined Consumer Tech as any product that is a service or app; to be used directly by a consumer (not an enterprise); and falls outside of the traditional industries such as HealthTech and FinTech There are several macroeconomic trends at play within our cohort: The (Continued) Rise of E-Commerce: Last month; Ally Commerce reported more than 57% of 2;000+ consumer brand manufacturers are embracing direct-to-consumer (“DTC”) distribution models; including e-commerce. They are reacting to the success of common household brands like Dollar Shave Club and Warby Parker. Increasing Interest in HealthTech: In Q1 2018; Dreamit Ventures reported a 10.2% increase of total funding to digital health startup. We foresee this trend increasing as innovations occur in traditional healthcare delivery. Rise of Robo Advisors: Just like at our FinTech panel in September; there is increasing interest for FinTech startups. Last month; Bloomberg reported 1;400 FinTech investments in 2018 alone. These categories included digital banking; payments; and emerging market companies. As neo- and challenger-banks continue to build; will the incumbents swing back? Decline in New Social Network Startups: As so-called tech unicorns Facebook and Snapchat continue to battle the United States government; or each other; there seems to be less startup growth in this category compared to other categories with quicker revenue-generating business models. 5) 39% of startups had no prior financial investments. Our team was not surprised to see the skewed distribution in investments between $50;000 and $400;000. Startups generally seek small rounds from friends; family; and angel investors; in addition to self-funding. A majority of our applicants have been in operation for more than 1 year; and have bootstrapped entirely. The average investment in a social network startup who applied was nearly $2 million. The applicants in the social network industry credited their initial funds to friends/family rounds; investment groups; angel investors; with a majority of their funds coming from their investment groups. We theorize this is related to the capital intensive nature of building a social network; including technology; and that they will begin generating revenue later than most startups. 6) 21% are seeking over $1 million in capital. Excludes one startup; who requested an investment amount of $15 M USD; for visual ease. At a high level; funds sought ran the gamut from $23;000 to $15 million. When we dug deeper; looking at industry trends; we found more interesting insights. Startups who applied in the Social Network; SaaS; and HealthTech industries requested 151% more funding than the average applicant. We are not sure of the main driver without learning what the requested funds would be used for. We suspect from our industry knowledge that funding wold be used for a combination of R&D and human capital; primarily engineering and a qualified sales force. We hope you enjoyed learning about the startups who applied to our first cohort as much as we did. We look forward to sharing more results from the pilot in the coming weeks.

When Technology and Humanity Collide,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write When Technology and Humanity Collide Shawn Hamman · Follow 9 min read · Jan 1; 2019 1 1 I’ve found that some of the most interesting ideas are formed around the messy; rapidly developing blending of technology and humanity. One such techno/human fusion is Twitter; a place where somewhat slow-changing society and culture comes up hard against fast changing technology; creating inevitable emotional turbulence and much uncertainty; while furiously generating and spreading new ideas and new concepts. That’s the one real utility that Twitter has for me; it’s why I follow the diverse set of people I do in an attempt to avoid an echo chamber and be open to diverse and contrasting views; as annoying as this sometimes is. I came across a tweet recently that tied together some fascinating threads of messy techno/human confluences for me — concepts where human nature; technology and ethics are colliding in an interesting and unexpected way: luck; self-driving cars and Chinese social credit scores. It suggestively questioned how awful it would be if self-driving cars in China were to use the reportedly planned Chinese “social credit system” to make the choice between who lives and who dies in accident situations. Presumably those with a “better” score get spared over those with a worse score; with the immediate proposition being that that would be awful. Perhaps it would be and; if I were a betting man; I’d put money on most people thinking that it would be at least some flavour of unpleasant. I wondered; would it actually be awful? And if so; why would it be awful? Self-Driving Cars A particularly tricky problem to solve in a self-driving car system is; for all intents and purposes; dealing with the real world manifestation of the classic ethical Trolley Problem thought experiment. Given an anticipated accident scenario where death or injury to somebody is unavoidable; how should a self driving car’s software ethically decide who the victim should be out of a set of options? For example; the software of a car might detect that an accident is inevitable and it has detected two categories of object in front of it and the only option available to it is avoiding one category of object over the other. Should it — the software — choose to drive into one child instead of a group of adults? Should it pick a couple of old people to die over a single young person? Should the car always save the driver over any other people? This is not a trivial problem to overcome and no doubt there will be extreme disagreement on how it eventually gets solved. It’s become a very real challenge for the legion of programmers working on what will likely be one of the most profound changes to society to date (and; in my opinion; the most interesting software challenges in the world to be working on right now). Is it even possible to have an acceptable way of rank ordering the value of people when it comes to making life and death decisions? The Implications of Automation and Decision Delegation Most people don’t need to think through ethical conundrums like the Trolley Problem and throughout history this kind of thing has generally been left to philosophers and clergy to contemplate. We; as a species; are now rapidly moving past the information age and into the age of automation; the Fourth Industrial Revolution; the confluence of technologies blurring the lines between the physical and the digital. Breakthroughs in a number of fields are driving this revolution forward — robotics; machine learning; artificial intelligence; hyper-connectedness through high bandwidth; the (industrial) internet of things. What perhaps isn’t so obvious is that using artificial intelligence; machine learning and automation technologies (especially complex automation technology like self-driving cars) is effectively delegating and outsourcing the (increasingly more often) serious and complex (and ethical) decision making to machines. By its nature; solving a problem with software typically requires programmers to formally codify in excruciating detail the decision making or solutioning process. For complex decisions this is extremely challenging and sometimes impossible. This difficulty; along with improvements in computer hardware and access to large amounts of data has driven the field of machine learning and artificial intelligence forward. One of the issues with artificial intelligence; neural networks and machine learning in general is that it’s difficult (if not impossible) to explain exactly how a decision is made or a result obtained because of the nature of how problems are solved by the technology and the nature of the problem space to which it is applied. This is a real impediment when trying to determine accountability; particularly in high-consequence scenarios. Ironically this means that delegated decision making in something like the automation of driving inherently requires us — programmers; people — to either address and formally answer complex ethical challenges like the Trolley Problem for all possible scenarios by hand or employ nearly-opaque; nearly-black-box technology that makes it difficult or impossible to explain how a decision was made. Addressing the Trolley Problem inherently means having to; at some point; rank people (or categories of people) in order of preference: who to kill and who not to kill. Will it be important to us as a society and as individuals to know exactly how and why a machine decided that one person lived while another died? Would it be better if a decision was made taking into account as much data about the individuals as possible? Or will simpler; impersonal categorical choice be acceptable; perhaps even be preferred? Social Credit Widely reported this year (Business Insider; Bloomberg); the Chinese central government; ever practical and efficient authoritarians; are said to be leveraging Big Data technology and ubiquitous surveillance to implement an explicit “social credit scoring” system; effectively standardising the assessment of each citizen’s business; economic and social reputation. If one thinks about it; in the West (whether intentionally or not); various social media combined with credit scores already can (and do; effectively) function as an implicit social credit score. Whether planned or haphazard; both implicit and explicit scoring mechanisms seem to have similar and largely punitive outcomes: say or do the wrong things where your score is measured and you could lose your job or access to opportunities. Generate a bad credit score and access to financial or social services could become more challenging. Interestingly; the very idea of a planned social scoring system seems to be universally reviled in the West. Most people I’ve come across with an opinion on the topic — like the tweet that started this off — flinch at the thought of what the Chinese government might be up to. It seems extremely dark and dystopian with what we imagine to be some terrible consequences. The very concept seems to bring up a natural revulsion and I’ve seen it described in many negative terms: “awful”; “terrible”; “shuddering at the thought”; “worrying”. The US Vice President Mike Pence described it as “an Orwellian system premised on controlling virtually every facet of human life.” The push-back against the pervasive; already implemented Western platforms of Google; Facebook; Twitter and YouTube doesn’t seem to be quite so vociferous; however. I can’t help but wonder if it’s the more explicative central planning approach that resonates too much with Communism; or a just bit of a cultural blindspot at work there; where much is forgiven or overlooked in the name of capitalism and profit. On Trust I think there are two primary reasons for people (in the West at least) to be deeply skeptical of the planned; explicit Chinese social credit scoring system. The first and obvious one lies in the judicious granting of trust to those who would define; operate and apply such a scoring system. Can the people who are trying to implement this system be trusted to implement it fairly; securely; impartially and keep it from being abused? Can the system; even if implemented initially to meet the aforementioned conditions; be guaranteed to stay that way over time? I think the easy answer is no; it’s not likely or at the very least extremely difficult to get right. The consequences for getting it wrong seem like they could be pretty dire. An interesting counterfactual to contemplate is if; for the sake of argument; a social credit scoring system could be implemented and operated by a completely trustworthy; fair and impartial; benevolent super AGI; able to take into account all aspects of a person to generate the score; would there still be an objection to the concept? Is there utility in having a “social credit score”; implementation and operation aside? The second reason for Western skepticism of the concept of a social credit score is that it seems to boil down to another class system; albeit a significantly more complex and granular one. The way society seems to be trying to reduce competition in schools and the prevailing social justice opinions that seem to be insisting on equality and equity in all things doesn’t align very well with the concept: instead of having two or three classes (which already exist); the social credit score can effectively be an infinite number of individual classes and the presentation of this is much starker. The very concept tries to quantify the worth of one individual over the other which isn’t a particularly palatable approach; particularly in the West. That; in itself; is worth considering: why is quantifying the worth of individuals and ranking them so off-putting? On Luck A third and perhaps less obvious reason is that what a “social credit score” is measuring is in fact not value or reputation exactly; but rather an aggregate of a subset of an individual’s luck across an arbitrarily chosen number of measurable dimensions. Most if not all things about a person comes down to luck. It is the extremely unpalatable but entirely factual way of the universe. The genes you’re born with; the family you’re born into; the city; state; country you happen to be born in; the environment you grow up in; the air you breathe; the food you eat; the people who surround you; the culture you exist in: none of it is your doing. You made none of the choices for your circumstance or any of the things that you physically are. The choices you think you’ve made were made with the mental machinery that you had no influence in creating; that was entirely determined by what came before you; by the genes you were conceived with and where you happen to have come into being. By chance. Luck: good; bad or ugly. Everything about you and me and everybody else is a measure of luck along some dimension. The difficulty with a social credit score then is that it is an imperfect measure of how lucky or unlucky a person is. The trouble is that nearly all societies take a punitive approach to non-conforming and non-performing individuals. Once you realise that a person’s disposition is effectively due to luck and their actions too are due to luck — good or bad — punishing bad luck and rewarding good luck seems somewhat cruel. Quantifying how lucky a person is to inform decision making about an individual in the context of society — even if that quantification is useful or valuable in predicting future behaviour and a net benefit to society as a whole — without a commensurate change in the society from a punitive to a supportive and restorative approach with regard to misbehaviour seems intuitively unfair. Conclusion Even if cultural differences (between East and West perhaps) cause the concept of a social credit score to be looked at differently; the tsunami wave of big data technology; fanatical metrics collection; pervasive social media and the hyper-connectedness of everything has meant that people are being quantified and scored whether they know it; like it or not. It is happening. For the moment; purportedly explicitly in the East; and definitely implicitly in the West. Whether this scoring will turn out to be a net benefit to society or not remains to be seen. That same technology wave is also forcing forward progress in automation which will inevitably mean machines making serious ethical decisions on our behalf and it is not clear if we will prefer those ethical decisions to be made with hyper-personal data — something like social credit scores — or if we’d be more comfortable with semi-anonymous; categorical decisions. The near future will surely be some of the most interesting years in human experience. Sign up to discover human stories that deepen your understanding of the world. Free Distraction-free reading.

Biochipping & Blockchain — Dystopian or Decentralized Future?,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write Member-only story Biochipping & Blockchain — Dystopian or Decentralized Future? Patrick Tan · Follow Published in Predict · 9 min read · Jan 1; 2019 54 Casino looked suspiciously like a hotel. Of all the table games at casinos; I’ve always had a preference for blackjack — in particular because if you play disciplined basic strategy and count cards and the casino doesn’t use a card shuffling machine but deals from a 6-deck shoe (plus another bunch of rules which I won’t go into detail with); you can get the odds to within 48.5% in favor of the player — meaning the house has its odds whittled down to 1.5% over a disciplined player. Mind you; I use the term “disciplined;” not “skilled.” That’s because anybody can be a decent blackjack player with discipline and hard work — which is why so few people do it — beyond a point; it becomes a job. Unfortunately; this particular evening I wasn’t playing in Vegas; or even Reno for that matter; but instead at the glitzy (not) “Integrated Resort” (but really it’s a casino) in Singapore — Marina Bay Sands. At the behest of some guests; I was playing a decent game at the blackjack table; enjoying some casual banter with my guests and some steely eyed ladies of leisure; when my phone buzzed indicating that a small transaction had been placed on my credit card to purchase train tickets at London’s Paddington Station. “Interesting;” I thought; “How did I buy those tickets from almost 7;000 miles away?” In an instant; I knew that my credit card had been compromised; but I wasn’t about to call the credit card company yet as I didn’t want to give up my seat at the blackjack table. Then the second buzz came in; this time for air tickets and judging by the amount; probably first class air tickets as well. What started off as an irritation now took on slightly more urgency. Much to my chagrin; I had to step away from the table; give up my seat and dial in to the concierge to stop the transactions and to cancel my credit card. Needless to say; the evening (which had started off pleasantly) had now taken on a far more different complexion. “We can put a man on the moon; but we can’t secure our credit card transactions?” For all the progress made in securing online credit card transactions (dollars to donuts my card was compromised online); the internet was never designed nor structured for the breadth and depth of transactions we’ve subjected it to. We’ve come a long way no doubt; but perhaps we can take things even further. Create an account to read the full story. The author made this story available to Medium members only.

After a couple of conversations; I’ve made the decision to re-boot my blog. As an introduction; I will tell you a little about myself; my interests and what you can expect from The Spark. About Me My name is Shahir Mishriki; and I am a working professional based out of Calgary; Alberta. I studied chemical engineering before pursuing a career in business consulting. Prior to moving to Calgary; I lived in Edmonton for four years after immigrating to Canada from Cairo; Egypt when I was 14 years old. My Interests I have been fascinated by the make of a strong leader; which I will unpack throughout The Spark. Outside of work; my passions include food; politics; law and technology. I am curious about the ‘inverse’ of patterns and how they can change our perspectives. My Aspirations My dream career is one that combines Business; Technology & Law (or Policy). If I had any job in the world; I would want to be a chief editor for the Economist (maybe the data-driven sections). My Day Job After graduation; I opted for a career in consulting. As a manager; my full-time job is to lead a team of problem solvers assigned to tackle a business challenge; mostly for Global 2000 Resources [Energy; Mining; Chemicals and Utilities] Companies. In other ‘buzzwords’; I transform and evolve how my clients do business by leveraging digital technologies. How I do it? I drill into a business problem to understand what is driving it. I find solutions that solve the problem (and often times I dream them up). Sometimes new technologies are part of the answer. We creatively find new ways to make sense of all the data we have. What are these new innovations you may ask? Examples include Artificial Intelligence-powered analytics and the Internet of things (sensors & various real-time data sources) Ok; enough about work. let me tell you more about what you can expect from this forum. What Do I Get From The Spark? A fusion of topics: Business; Leadership; Technology; Food; Politics and Society. Don’t expect them to be nicely catalogued into their little silos.

You Probably Don’t Want A Thicker iPhone,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write You Probably Don’t Want A Thicker iPhone Even if it has better battery life; a thicker phone isn’t always advantageous. Isaac Young · Follow Published in Techstream · 4 min read · Jan 1; 2019 29 The iPhone XR tips the scales at 8.3mm and 194g. Photo by stevepb on Pixabay. If you’ve ever bought or seen any Apple products; you’ll know that first and foremost; they are a design company. From the trendy iBook to today’s MacBook; Apple’s devices look stunning. However; if you’ve owned an iPhone; you’ll know that battery life is one of the iPhone’s most limiting factors. My personal iPhone 6s lasts barely 4 hours with my usage. Like many online; I’ve always wondered: “Why doesn’t Apple make a thicker phone with better battery life?” It sounds perfect on paper: a phone with great thermals; unending battery life; and performance to boot — and all you have to trade is a little heft. But are you really willing to take that deal? The Apple product experience When Apple debuted the ultra-thin MacBook in 2015; it was a controversial device. The knee-jerk reaction of the community was to incessantly question it. Was one port too few? Was the keyboard too thin for its own good? Would people pay the premium for it? The answer to all those questions turned out to be yes; but in person; the main reaction was to look at it. “Look at it! It’s so thin; it tapers off to almost nothing!” If you thought that was a one-off; take a look at what people were saying about the new 5.9mm thick iPad Pros. “Yes it bends; but have you seen how thin it is?” Apple knows all too well the reaction of its customers when they see their products — first impressions count. People that fall in love with a product at first sight will most likely buy it; so Apple wants to create a positive first impression. Apple has also built a reputation on sleek and slim devices. Since the MacBook Air; introduced in 2008; Apple has been squeezing devices as slim as possible; and people like it. The MacBook Air released to much fanfare; and sold in droves even though it was monstrously overpriced; with a $1;399 64GB SSD. This has been Apple’s modus operandi for so long that people have come to expect it; and are shocked when anything is released that doesn’t look as elegant as they expect. While often glossed over in day to day debates; “handfeel” is one of the most important things for a product that is placed predominantly in the hand. A thicker phone; even by a little bit; is noticeable when you use your phone day in day out. Of course; with their expansive R&D department; Apple knows this; so phones are made as ergonomically as possible; with thickness kept in check. Apple is so focused on ergonomics; that when originally releasing the iPhone 5 with the taller display; they set out developer guidelines for ‘safe zones’ where a right-handed user could and couldn’t touch without stretching. This kind of thoughtfulness is thrown out the window if your phone weighs 400 grammes and has the portability of a brick. The iPhone XR Problem Since the iPhone 6s; Apple has reversed their stance and started thickening their iPhones; bit by bit. The response was mostly positive up to the iPhone X; which was the thickest iPhone since the iPhone 4s. However; things changed when Apple released the iPhone XR at 8.3mm; a full 0.6mm thicker than the iPhone X. The iPhone XR was meant to be everything that people had been asking for; for almost a decade. It was cheaper than the flagship phone. It had the same performance. It had better battery life; and as a result; it was a little thicker. Aiming to please everyone; it debuted with a multitude of different colors; including the sought after Product (Red). What was not to like? But the community went bonkers over it. “It’s too thick!”; they cried. “Look on the bezels on that!” “Why is the screen so low resolution?”. These three quotes show Apple’s true market. Apple fans; no matter what they say; don’t want a thick phone with great battery life. Never before have Henry Fords words rung more true: “If I’d asked customers what they wanted; they would have told me; ‘A faster horse!” — Henry Ford The iPhone XR is a great phone. It’s everything people have been asking for; and some extra. Yes; the screen is lower resolution than the iPhone X; but if you’re looking close enough to notice the pixels; then you should check your viewing distances. The resolution doesn’t need to improve past what Apple dubs “Retina” — There aren’t any VR headsets for iPhone; so your eyes shouldn’t be that close to the screen anyway. And yet; people refuse to buy the iPhone XR. It isn’t selling nearly as well as Apple had hoped; and the fanfare is minimal. The iPhone XR simply doesn’t have the sex appeal that past iPhones have had. This is the problem with the proposal that people have brought up for years — it simply isn’t viable for a company like Apple to produce a phonezilla with unending battery life. Conclusion If you’re in the market for an iPhone right now; I would highly recommend the iPhone XR. It’s not good looking by any means; but it has almost all the features of the iPhone XS at a fraction of the price. It has better battery life than both flagships; and will likely have better performance; thanks to it’s lower resolution screen. However; if you’re like most; your gut will tell you the iPhone XR isn’t right for you; because it probably isn’t. It doesn’t feel the same in the hand; and it doesn’t have the flagship feeling of the XS and XS Max. It isn’t the quintessential iPhone experience you’ve come to know and love. While the voice of reason is telling you to buy the XR; it won’t be the one living with it for 3–5 years. You will. Sign up to discover human stories that deepen your understanding of the world.

Messaging Queue? Makanan apa itu?,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write Photo by Annie Spratt at Unsplash Messaging Queue? Makanan apa itu? danish jatmiko · Follow 5 min read · Jan 1; 2019 33 Happy New Year 2019 for everyone who celebrate! Selamat datang di post pertama saya di medium. Salah satu hal yang ingin saya mulai kerjakan di tahun ini adalah untuk mulai menulis dan sharing beberapa hal yang saya ketahui melalui pengalaman dan hasil pembelajaran saya selama ini dengan sesederhana mungkin. Untuk post pertama ini saya menggunakan Bahasa Indonesia agar lebih memudahkan saja; pastinya juga karena saya sadar bahasa Inggris saya buruk XD. Mengenai topicnya sendiri; mengapa MQ(Messaging Queue)? Saya memilih topic ini karena ini adalah salah satu konsep yang paling challenging untuk saya pahami saat join Tokopedia pertama kalinya; dan sangat menarik untuk dipelajari terutama untuk teman-teman yang baru masuk ke dunia web engineering. Apa ya MQ ini? Sederhananya MQ adalah suatu bentuk komunikasi antar service secara asynchronous. Dimana konsep ini banyak digunakan dalam dunia web yang menggunakan microservice architecture. Biasanya konsep ini digunakan untuk memisahkan banyak proses yang berat; batch processing; dan untuk segala sesuatu yang tidak harus diselesaikan secara synchronous. Ada 3 komponen utama dalam sebuah konsep MQ. Yaitu Producer; Queue Platform; dan Consumer. Producer adalah suatu service yang akan membagikan/publish message berupa data kepada service lainnya. Queue Platform adalah suatu service yang berfungsi untuk mendistribusikan/membagikan message yang berasal dari Producer ke setiap Consumer yang ada. Consumer adalah satu atau banyak service yang akan mengolah data yang diberikan oleh Producer melalui Queue Platform. Gambaran Proses Komunikasi Dengan MQ. Sebentar; kok dari tadi gua ga paham maksud Queue dalam MQ? Sama seperti artinya; Queue berarti antrian dalam Bahasa Indonesia. Queue Platform sangat berperan dalam mewujudkan antrian data dari Producer ke Consumer. Data yang diberikan oleh produser tidak akan didistribusikan langsung ke consumernya; melainkan akan dibuatkan sebuah antrian dimana consumer akan memproses data satu per satu sesuai dengan antrian yang ada. Contohnya; suatu saat Producer melakukan publish 1000 data dalam 1 detik; namun consumer yang ada hanya mampu memproses 10 data per 1 detik. Maka akan dibuatkan sebuah antrian dari 1000 data tersebut menggunakan konsep FIFO (First In First Out). Dalam kasus ini semua data akan terselesaikan dalam waktu 100 detik. Dari contoh tersebut bisa dilihat penerapan MQ untuk batch processing. Lalu untuk sedekar informasi juga; kita bisa menggunakan 2 atau lebih consumer untuk memproses data yang sama. Dalam kasus di atas kita menganggap bahwa hanya ada 1 consumer; bagaimana bila kita memiliki 5 consumer untuk memproses sebuah antrian (1000 data)? dengan kecepatan 1 consumer = 10 data/detik; maka bila ada 5 consumer = 50 data/detik. 1000 data akan bisa diselesaikan dalam waktu 20 detik saja. Pusing bos; ada contoh kasusnya gak? Untuk lebih memudahkan untuk memahami konsep MQ; saya akan berikan sedikit contoh sederhana dalam penerapan MQ. Bayangkan saja anda adalah engineer akan mendevelop sebuah marketplace online; dimana ada salah satu order yang akan di konfirmasi oleh pembeli bahwa barang telah sampai. Kira-kira proses yang akan terjadi setelah pembeli konfirmasi adalah: Update status transaksi menjadi selesai. Berikan uang pada penjual; dan potong uang pajak dll. Update status toko dan barang. Update status transaksi berhasil. Kirim notifikasi email dan sms. Tambah reputasi dan ulasan. dll. Mungkin pada saat pertama kali marketplace online anda release; semua poin di atas tidak masalah bila dijalankan secara synchronous. Namun bagaimana bila semakin banyak business model yang diinginkan? Misal ingin menambah pengecekan fraud; atau notifikasi berupa Whatsapp; bahkan memberikan bonus dan promo tambahan ke pembeli? Kita perlu memikirkan kembali arsitektur kita. Dalam kasus di atas; kita bisa menggunakan konsep MQ. Producer dalam kasus ini adalah service yang bagian mengupdate status transaksi saja; lalu setelah itu publish data ke Queue Platform; dimana data ini akan didistribusikan ke services consumer bagian update status toko; barang; tambah reputasi; kirim notifikasi; promo; dll. Setiap consumer akan memproses data yang diterima masing-masing tanpa mengganggu consumer lainnya. Update status transaksi menjadi selesai merupakan proses synchronous yang tak dapat dihindari; namun untuk mengirim email; notifikasi; update status toko; tambah reputasi; berikan uang kepada penjual merupakan proses yang tidak harus saat itu juga berhasil; atau dalam artian lain masih bisa dimaklumi bila terjadi sedikit delay. Dengan hanya proses Update status transaksi yang menjadi proses utama dan synchronous; maka process time web service anda akan relatif lebih cepat daripada harus menjalankan lebih dari 10 business model sekaligus. Selain itu ini juga baik secara UX karena user tidak perlu menunggu lama. Keuntungan lainnya bosque? Menurut saya pribadi; fungsi utama dari MQ adalah kemampuan untuk berkomunikasi antar service tanpa harus berhubungan dengan langsung melalui API atau HTTP Protocol lainnya. Jadi antar service itu bisa tak saling mengenal; tapi masih mungkin berkomunikasi. Atau dalam bahasa Inggris dikenal dengan istilah Decouple. Dalam dunia microservices; ketergantungan antar service harus ditekan seminimal mungkin; tujuannya agar apabila suatu service down; maka service yang lainnya tidak perlu ikut down juga. Contohnya dalam kasus contoh konfirmasi buyer di atas; apabila saat ingin konfirmasi; tetapi service reputasi dan email down; apakah harus fitur konfirmasi ini ikutan gagal juga? dengan adanya MQ ini; apabila service email ataupun reputasi down; data untuk kedua service ini tidak hilang; tersimpan dalam queue dan dapat diproses kembali ketika kedua service tersebut Up. Dan secara UX baik karena buyer tetap berhasil konfirmasi. Hmmm; Kayanya pernah tau konsep ini di jaman kuliah dulu; ini Observer pattern gak sih? Pada awalnya saat saya belajar MQ; saya kira ini adalah observer pattern. Tapi setelah membaca artikel ini; saya jadi sadar bahwa konsep MQ ini berbeda sekali dengan Observer pattern; konsep MQ ini biasa dikenal dengan pub-sub pattern. Secara sederhana perbedaan utamanya adalah; kalau di pub-sub pattern; antara publisher dan subscriber itu tidak saling mengenal dan tidak terhubung secara langsung. Ada pihak ketiga yang berperan sebagai mediator untuk publisher dan subscriber saling berkomunikasi. Namun di Observer pattern; antara Object dan Observernya sudah saling mengenal terlebih dahulu dan mereka saling berkomunikasi secara langsung ketika ada suatu event. Untuk lebih jelasnya teman-teman bisa membaca artikel di link ini. Akhirnyaa…. Terima kasih teman-teman sudah meluangkan waktu untuk membaca artikel pertama saya ini. Saya tahu masih banyak kekurangan dalam artikel ini; oleh karena itu saya juga terbuka untuk saran dan kritik untuk kebaikan kita bersama. Bila ada konsep atau penjelasan saya yang kurang tepat; saya juga mohon maaf dan kita bisa diskusikan lagi di kolom komentar dibawah ya.

北歐創業論壇SLUSH工作人員申請介紹 下篇,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write 北歐創業論壇SLUSH工作人員申請介紹 下篇 Wes Hsu · Follow Published in Wes Conference Review · 15 min read · Jan 1; 2019 22 前面介紹完志工申請的步驟，下篇將接續我在會場中遇到的參展攤位，以及當地的一周行程安排，其中還包含芬蘭獨立日與新創團隊工作環境的參訪。最後還有工作人員專屬的派對分享，如果還沒瀏覽上篇的讀者可以點擊下方連結。北歐創業論壇SLUSH工作人員申請介紹上篇。 北歐創業論壇SLUSH工作人員申請介紹 上篇 SLUSH工作人員申請經驗與論壇參展評論。上半段著重申請流程與時間順序，以及工作現場的實際經歷與反思。下半段則是與參展團體在會場互動的分享和會後的行程建議。合計兩篇總共九千字的文章。 medium.com [會場的演講、推廣與招募] 今年主場館有三大舞台，創辦人舞台(Founder Stage)，粉紅舞台(Pink Stage)，恆綠舞台(Evergreen Stage)，每個場地的演講節目表都十分緊湊，每場長度約二十分鐘，加入主持人的串場一天可以安排將近二十場講座，講者涵蓋了潛力獨角獸企業的創辦人、科技評論網站編輯、風險投資公司顧問、歐盟委員會官員、赫爾辛基市長、資訊科技教育家與加密貨幣發行人等，議題的設定也包括了農業科技、大數據分析、機器學習、擴增實境、區塊鍊、加密貨幣、資訊安全、教育創新、電子支付、物聯網、時尚流行產業與運輸物流業等，我一天基本上只聽兩三場，留下深刻印象的兩場，分別是無人機顛覆運輸產業(Launch: Transforming Delivery)，主講人是無人機貨物運輸服務公司Wing的執行長James Ryan Burgess；以及輿論戰場與媒體現況(Info war and peace: The current state of media)，採用訪談形式，主持人是富比世雜誌(Forbes)的歐洲編輯Alex Wood，接受訪問的是科技新聞網站TechCrunch的前共同總編輯Alexia Bonatsos。前者是從Google X專案中畢業的新創企業，在會議中也宣布明年春季開始在芬蘭試營運的計畫，並驕傲地表示會議前一周在寒冷環境下的成功試飛，給了工程團隊很大的信心，在歐洲後續的服務國家也能克服溫度所造成的續航力限制。然而二十分鐘過去，編號7000的原型機，還是只靜靜置於講桌，沒有實際起飛與展示包裹以繩索垂降的遞送方式，只用一分鐘的形象影片作說明，是讓在場眾多航空迷一個小小失望的原因。後者是討論媒體識讀(Media literacy)以及如何提升報導品質的論壇，由於紙媒與網路媒體對於閱聽人的生活影響力比例逐年改變，未經查證的資訊或是帶有偏見的評論變得更容易散播，而對民主與社會造成的傷害也是不分國界的，我想台灣能從國際間借鏡打擊假新聞的策略，來讓四年後的公投能反映出更加成熟的民主素養。 無人機貨物運輸服務公司Wing的執行長 James Ryan Burgess 與編號7000原型機 對於琳瑯滿目的講座選擇，大家不需要給自己太大的壓力把自由時段排入過多的節目，因為我並不建議將會場的時間都坐在座位上聽演講，一來是所以的演講影片都會在幾周內上傳影音平台YouTube的SLUSH官方頻道，二來是這些大型的演講大多不提供問答時間，除了少部分主持人接受觀眾互動軟體Slido的幾個問題，如果真的對於幾場演講有高度興趣，可以查看工作室訪談(Studio)節目表，兩個大舞台有想對應的如創辦人工作室(Founder Studio)與粉紅工作室(Pink Studio)，另一個同樣精彩的是展場工作室(Showcase Studio)。如果講者有前往工作室接受提問的行程，建議安排好換場步行時間，因為工作室的場地都是只能容納幾十人的小空間，比起上百人湧入的大舞台，需要更多捷足先登的策略。 除了這些固定節目外，場地其他部分如同我們在南港展覽館看到的攤位，只是換成深色的背景，搭配無所不在的霓虹燈配色燈光與雷射，再加上很多佈景主題甚至搭建起二樓的商務洽談專屬空間，讓投資者與創業者擁有更多的隱私。現場很多新創公司或是巨型跨國公司都展示虛擬實境(Virtual Reality)的服務，我在兩天親身體驗了三種不同的應用，第一個是名為Glue的芬蘭新創，可以連接地球兩端的團隊成員，在虛擬的會議室開會聽簡報，產品建模也能依照比例呈現，並且自由的在空間中翻轉；第二個是以柏林為基地的新創公司Athena，致力於原型車體內部設計，如座椅的擺設，而車窗以外的景色也隨著時間從郊區駛入市中心的高樓大廈環境，視覺化完整的乘車體驗。 瑞典機器人與自動化企業ABB的虛擬實境體驗 最後一個是來自瑞典的機器人與自動化跨國企業ABB(Asea Brown Boveri)，直接引入電動方程式(Formula E)的競速遊戲，坐上可調式的低底盤賽車駕駛座，戴上虛擬實境眼鏡後手握方向盤開始比賽，由於過彎時的方向盤轉向反饋很強烈，視角畫面的流暢度很極高，我非常推薦大家在其他展覽也能親自體驗他們的遊戲。此外會場還有很多我這次來不及嘗試的服務應用，如芬蘭航空(Finnair)讓使用者潛入機場停機坪或是維修棚，模擬操作連結空橋的任務以及更換起降輪零件的工作，與醫療器材製造商廠嬌生公司(Johnson & Johnson)也導入醫院的手術模擬訓練，讓訪客可以依造指示進行膝關節手術。 當然，除了虛擬實境體驗外，單純跟參展者討論他們從事的科技領域也能帶來新鮮感。我在一個展示多音軌混音互動盤前面先是調整了幾顆球的位置，而感應器會依據位置改變節拍的頻率和節奏，隨著兩個八拍的反覆播放，可以輕易編出稍有節奏感的背景音樂。而後進了他們的展區，才發現這並不是一家音樂新創，而是北歐那斯達克(NASDAQ OMX)的上市公司，一家跨足工業解決方案、雲端儲存與數位諮詢的資通訊公司Tieto Oyj，他先介紹了赫爾辛基的能源管理服務，監控離峰與尖峰時段的電力配置，同時我們也聊到台灣近期公投的議題，因為芬蘭目前已有四座運轉中的核能發電模組，供應全國將近三成的電力需求，他也如實的說政府計畫在Olkiluoto與Hanhikivi兩地續建新的反應爐，在2025年預計提升至六成的發電總量，同時減少對於燃煤與燃氣的比重，也就是減少對於俄羅斯的能源依賴。另外我也在歐洲太空總署(European Space Agency)的攤位前遇到熱情的參展人，跟我介紹他們利用衛星監看泰國的河川流量變化，藉以預警曼谷潛在的洪水入侵，是與政府合作的一個成功案例。在全球盛名的新創論壇SLUSH，我們的科技大國當然不會缺席，參展攤位是由經濟部選出的潛力新創企業所佈展，我也跟兩家企業的參展者聊了自家的產品與服務，分別為防近視智能筆以及天晴青年旅店，前者研發一款偵測過度寫字角度與身體傾角以收回筆頭的智能筆，同時限制在低光源的環境下使用；後者是注重隱私的青年旅館，比起歐洲常見的三十床混宿房間，他們只提供雙人到六人的上下鋪房間，讓亞洲旅客安心入住。 短短的兩天要體驗所有的會場特色，我覺得我連一半都無法達成，例如官方企業媒合(Matchmaking)的線上平台，給予志工與新創與會投資客等交流機會，在SLUSH的系統內填寫自己的專業、經驗與想要工作的產業與角色，就可以瀏覽各個潛在合夥人的檔案，並直接送出會議洽談邀請，成功媒合後在會場區域(Meeting Area)就可以安排時段使用官方的小型面試空間。雖然我這次沒有嘗試這項功能，不過我的交換生志工朋友(非歐盟公民)，面試成功的例子可以讓大家當作參考，他是碩士班的資料科學家，預計在明年六月畢業，而應徵上了挪威新創的科技長位置，在撰寫畢業論文同時處理工作簽證，我也期待在近期內聽到他的更多好消息。會期的大量周邊活動(Side events)，我也因為排班時間錯過許多節目，像是台灣新創競技場(Taiwan Startup Stadium)與芬蘭的創業加速器中心Maria 01合作推出台灣芬蘭發表日的活動(Taiwan x Finland Demo Day)，讓十組新創一同交流展示服務。 官方企業媒合(Matchmaking)的線上平台，圖片取自SLUSH網站 [會期的食衣住行] 前面談了那麼多的場內場外大小活動，接下來再回到志工的日常，還有如何準備這幾天的吃住等細節問題。我們排班的時間都有些許空檔可以用餐，組長會負責盒裝的簡餐，不過在志工訓練當天會拿到另外的一張餐券，在會場的二樓自助餐使用，瑞典肉丸是少不了的，還有各式沙拉吧，不過有時間效期的限制，像我拿到的是晚班的餐券，使用時間約是九點至凌晨一點。除此之外，志工休息區備有簡單的食物跟飲品，像是堅果、洋芋片、香蕉或是咖啡跟氣泡飲料等，而新奇的食物也有，如花椰菜鹹派(Broccoli quiche)。不定時也會出現棉花糖的融絲機，志工可以手作纏繞自己的粉色棉花糖。會場覓食也是一個選擇，需要大排長龍的甘草糖(Liquorice)口味冰淇淋或是碰巧遇到發放肉桂捲的與會者也都是刺激味蕾的好方式。 關於住宿的部分，主辦單位只有提供志工住宿的建議，兩個選項都是青年旅館，一是會期三日的宿舍床位，地點離會場只需要十分鐘的軌道電車，三晚大概五十歐元；二是一整周的市區青旅，搭乘同一班軌道電車需要約半小時的時間，七晚約一百八十歐元。而關於交通，包含會前訓練與會期總共三天的行程，主辦單位會提供赫爾辛基區域交通局HSL (Helsingin Seudun Liikenne)的三日交通卡，可以搭乘赫爾辛基市區的大眾運輸工具如軌道電車、火車、公車以及捷運，從會場到市區可以選擇7號軌道電車或是密集的火車直達車。如果後續的行程也需要搭乘，可以買七十二小時的三日票，十八歐元，換算下來一天搭乘超過三趟，價值就超過手機購買每張二歐二十分的電子單程票券。 [芬蘭獨立日] 會期結束後的第一天(Dec. 6th)剛好是芬蘭獨立日，也適逢赫爾辛基中央圖書館(Helsingin keskustakirjasto Oodi)對外開幕的第二日。 赫爾辛基中央圖書館(Helsingin keskustakirjasto Oodi)的三樓開架室 三層樓的空間擠滿了各個年齡層的家庭成員，從入口停放的嬰兒車數量就能探出端倪，頂樓的玻璃帷幕內部是藏書超過一萬本的開架室，同時包含一個小舞台與一個講座空間，當天有童書故事時間和小提琴演奏，讓小孩與小小孩自由的在舞台前或坐或躺度過午後時光。我在翻閱書籍時也發現芬蘭人對性別平等教育的重視，中央區域的書櫃有幾排貼上彩虹標籤的英文書與芬蘭文書，這樣的題材能增進讀者對己身的性別意識。二樓則是多以工作室型態，多台3D印表機與裁縫機，讓樂於手作的市民可以不受手邊缺乏工具的限制。最後，一樓不意外的是設置茶點桌椅區，在芬蘭也能體會到瑞典式的Fika咖啡文化。中午過後人數抵達參訪上限，隨即管理入口的人流，讓進出的人數平衡，同時也能看到兩個出入口都排了超過百人的隊伍，讓我有種回到家鄉的錯覺。 芬蘭人慶祝獨立日的方式很平靜，夜幕低垂的時刻，即使還不到四點，學生舉著火把從郊區墓園旁的小教堂開始遊行，一路朝著市中心前進，繞過總統官邸後，在赫爾辛基主教座堂(Helsinki Cathedral)前面聚集，唱著聖歌(Choral singing)接著聽取市長的演說，也就是前天登上SLUSH恆綠舞台的座談人之一，不過如同芬蘭人含蓄的個性，整場遊行非常安靜，我參與了部分的路段，沒有聽到任何口號，也沒有施放狼煙的火炬。至於當天其他的利益團體是否也有上街頭抗議與示威，我本身只有目睹反法西斯團體高舉布條呼喊口號，內容是自由、友誼與團結(Vapaus; Toveruus & Solidaarisuus)，周圍雖然有警車戒備，但氣氛並不緊張，因為我們可以看到很多警員其實是拿著手機或是相機對著群眾拍照。雖然我沒有看到極右團體的出現，但是隔天的新聞也報導了示威中揮舞的右旋萬字旗(Swastika flags)被沒收並且有四人因此被羈押，隨後也遭各界嚴厲譴責。然而，我認為整體的氣氛也就如同另一項芬蘭傳統一樣沉著，即獨立日接見典禮(Linnan Juhlat)，超過千名的重要貢獻人士會被邀請至總統府，排成兩列緩緩前進一一與總統和第一夫人握手，不過這樣的節目卻能超過兩百萬人的收看，以總人口五百五十多萬人的芬蘭而言，我認為這是極高的比例。 芬蘭獨立日的學生遊行隊伍抵達終點赫爾辛基主教座堂(Helsinki Cathedral) [國際志工周的參訪] 為了讓遠道而來的國際志工能對北歐創業圈有更多了解，SLUSH也提供了國際志工周的行程，參訪了創業加速器，並且到當地新創的工作環境，與員工面對面談論開發產品的願景及未來的產業影響。大會結束後兩天是新創的參訪，第一站來到Maria 01，也就是三天前台灣芬蘭發表日的合作夥伴，他們是創立於2016年的非營利組織，志在打造一個北歐最大的新創校園，而場地就選在超過百年歷史的一座醫院遺址，而市政府也同意他們的企劃。取名來自於原本醫院的名字(Maria Hospital)，後面加上零一的靈感來自於風險資本家彼得提爾(Peter Thiel)的暢銷書。 新創空間 Maria 01 的商業策略討論室，圖片取自官方社群軟體Instagram 而目前一萬兩千平方公尺占地的工作空間已容納九十家新創公司，活絡的氣氛讓人很難想像這裡曾經是一座醫院，除了不定時在官方帳號限時動態發佈他們在地底通道又發現幾張遺棄的病床。 企業參訪行程中風險資本公司 MAKI.VC的會議空間 而後我們到了當地的風險資本(Venture Capital)企業MAKI.VC，雖然是2018年一月才開始注資的基金，但已手握八千萬歐元，投入三十家新創，而其中之一就是我前面寫到的虛擬實境公司Glue。在聽取財務長的簡報時，我們才逐漸了解獨角獸企業的概念，也就是在上市櫃前即估值超過十億美元的新創公司。而風險資本家投資標的就是找尋下一隻獨角獸，因為資本公司的投資報酬並不是計算每個項目的利潤，而是只要有一家明星標的的高報酬可以覆蓋其他虧損的新創，整體策略就算成功，因此獨角獸對於整個新創圈的投資氛圍是很重要的。最後一站，我們到了新創網路銀行Holvi，與我們常見到來自英國的Revolut或是Monzo以及來自德國的N26單純的消費金融卡不一樣，因為他們目標客群是線上購物商的經營者，也就是加強收款的功能，讓中小企業主給與消費者更多的付款選項，此外還有一個特點是他們與愛沙尼亞的電子公民計畫(e-Residency)有身份驗證的合作，如果使用者並非目前營運國家如芬蘭、德國與奧地利等的居民，可以運用電子公民的選項，而填寫其他地區的住址。 [志工限定會後派對] 在芬蘭一周的尾聲，是在周六晚上的志工專屬會後派對(Volunteer afterparty)，但是這次不像四天前官方的會後派對在主會場的巨大場地舉辦，而是移到郊區的改建倉庫活動場館，前身是國家鐵路局的火車頭生產廠房。派對的性質則是與先前相似，有廣大舞池與DJ台，飲品也是似曾相識的琴酒長飲、蘋果酒和拉格啤酒。 工作人員專屬會後派對的舉辦場地 不過整場派對最大的不同是，這次在工作崗位上的都不是先前看到的志工，而是指派工作給我們的頭仔，也就是在志工手冊上面看得到照片的大人物。當我們走進衣帽間準備領取號碼牌時就看到整場論壇的執行長，或是排隊領取盒裝食物時就是從營運長的手中接過泰式炒麵。這也是我整場旅程中對於芬蘭平等文化的最深刻印證，不論頭銜或是資歷，於不同時段在團隊中相互合作，切換工作角色以增進同理心，共同提升顧客體驗，也讓我想起十一月拿到的手冊中，他們花了三頁的篇幅敘述志工應該展現的正向態度，並且詳列行為準則，嚴禁各種形式的歧視，都是為了打造友善包容的組織文化以及優質的工作環境。 [小結] 一場看似能夠濃縮成兩天的大型活動，我認為用兩周的時間都無法路過每個攤位，或是僅僅了解每個區域的功能。而赫爾辛基也是，一周的時間無法見到她的全貌，這是我第三次拜訪辛基，但仍然是每天在不同角落發現嶄新世界。踏上歸途之前發現行李箱多了三本新創產業的出版品，分別是《Startup Guide Nordics》、《CoFounder: The SLUSH 2018 How To Pitch; Succeed & Win Issue》、《The State of European Tech》，完整消化應該是幾個月之後的事了，文章打到這裡也超過九千字了，最後做個簡短的收尾。希望計畫前往北歐創業圈發展的朋友能在論壇中找到合夥人或是天使投資人，也希望其他單純逛展的學生能認識新朋友也對北歐創業圈有多一點了解。歡迎讀者在下方留言，點擊掌聲或是分享給更多朋友。 Sign up to discover human stories that deepen your understanding of the world.

Why Apple Struggled in 2018: A Retrospective,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write Why Apple Struggled in 2018: A Retrospective Dane O'Leary · Follow Published in DataDrivenInvestor · 19 min read · Jan 2; 2019 -- 4 Photo courtesy of Apple Putting personal biases to the side; Apple is objectively one of the most important tech companies in existence today. Or at the very least; certainly the most influential. If you doubt that fact; consider this: Shortly after its release; the iPhone was almost unanimously viewed as the gold standard for smartphones. As a result; many other companies looked to Apple for hints at what consumer and mobile technology could and would become. And by mimicking Apple’s products in the hope of competing; those companies ultimately reinforced Apple’s vision for the future. In short; we’re living in a world where many of the products we use today; whether they have an Apple logo or not; were made in Apple’s image. But 2018 hasn’t been the best year for Apple; especially where the iPhone is concerned. After several generations of the same form factor and tired design; Apple unveiled the iPhone X as the next evolution of the iPhone. One of the most polarizing characteristics is the removal of the home button. To compensate; iOS gained a new gesture-based UI in an effort to bring us closer to the dream of an all-screen slab than we’d ever been. Though the new gesture controls and form factor made it somewhat polarizing at first; many reviews praised the iPhone X; calling it “the smartphone of the future.” In fact; there was so much excitement regarding what the iPhone X said about the future of the smartphone that at the start of 2018; the hype was only just starting to dissipate. Since we’ve turned a corner into the new year; it’s time to look back on Apple’s biggest hardware and software launches of 2018; paying particular attention to the mistakes that are obvious with the benefit of hindsight while also giving Apple due credit for several successes. Table of Contents Apple HomePod iPad 2018 with Pencil Support PRODUCT(RED) iPhone 8 & iPhone 8 Plus AirPlay 2 WWDC 2018 MacBook Pro 2018 iPhone XS & iPhone XR Apple Watch Series 4 iPad Pro 2018 Mac Mini 2018 Summary Apple HomePod (February 2018) Photo courtesy of Dan Masaoka/IDG The HomePod was supposed to be Apple’s answer to voice assistant-powered smart speakers like the Amazon Echo and Google Home. Originally announced in June 2017 for a December release; HomePod ended up getting delayed until its eventual launch in February. Unfortunately for Apple; once the HomePod was released and its limitations became clear; there simply wasn’t as much hype for the HomePod as there had been for the iPhone X. As a product; HomePod is only appealing if you’re already deeply ingrained in Apple’s ecosystem. HomePod is; as a product; only appealing to consumers who are already deeply ingrained in Apple’s ecosystem. Siri is the sole voice assistant on offer here and she’s proven; time and again; to be far less capable than the Google Assistant and Amazon’s Alexa by no small margin. [Just read “Apple’s Siri is an Embarrassment;” published by Forbes; if you don’t believe me.] Worst of all; HomePod lacks basic functions that competing high-end smart speakers have been offering; and much of that is due to the ineptitude of Siri. However; beyond the fact that Siri gets outclassed by all three of her main competitors when it comes to answering questions; most smart speakers let you connect multiple units simultaneously for stereo sound. While this was originally marketed as something HomePod could do; the feature wasn’t available out-of-the-box. Anyone who purchased more than one HomePod unit at launch soon discovered they needed AirPlay 2 for stereo sound and multi-room audio. In a review for CNET; Megan Wollerton highlighted another major drawback to the HomePod. Though she commended the HomePod for its incredible audio quality; making it a great speaker for audiophiles; Wollerton pointed out how HomePod has native support only for Apple’s own streaming music service; Apple Music. Spotify; Pandora; and other popular music streaming services — which are more ubiquitous than Apple Music — weren’t available without using AirPlay as a workaround. Normally; a speaker that doesn’t offer native support for your desired streaming service would offer a work-around with Bluetooth; but that’s not an option here. Just to be totally clear; let me state this clearly… Apple HomePod doesn’t have Bluetooth. For some reason; Bluetooth 5 is; in fact; listed among HomePod’s specifications although Android and Windows devices can’t leverage the Bluetooth to connect to HomePod. To use HomePod; you must have an iOS device. Assuming you have an iPhone; you could theoretically use AirPlay to push music from Spotify or your other music streaming service of choice to the HomePod; but for the steep price of $349 — which is higher than any Amazon Echo speaker but less than the Google Home Max — HomePod has niche appeal at best and is just too limited to truly be a smart speaker. Needless to say; it didn’t appear on many holiday wishlists. [Side note: Apple has continued updating HomePod’s software throughout the year. For what it’s worth; HomePod now offers better integration with other Apple products like Apple TV. It also now offers the ability to pair two HomePods for stereo sound with AirPlay 2; integration with your calendar; and several other features that; honestly; should’ve been available from launch.] New iPad with Apple Pencil Support (March 2018) Photo courtesy of Mashable In hindsight; the education-focused event held in Chicago in March 2018 ended up being one of Apple’s best moments of the year from a critical standpoint; so I’m including it here to give credit where credit’s due. However; there’s really not a ton to talk about. At the event; Apple unveiled the “New iPad;” revealing the long-awaited addition of Apple Pencil support; which makes the 2018 iPad newly relevant for educational uses. Best of all; you could buy the newest Pencil-compatible iPad for as little as $329; making it the lowest-priced device in Apple’s current hardware lineup. So; yes; this was certainly one of the bright spots of Apple’s year. PRODUCT(RED) iPhone 8 & iPhone 8 Plus (April 2018) Photo courtesy of Apple There’s not much to say about the launch of PRODUCT(RED) versions of the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus; either; besides Apple’s frustrating decision not to give iPhone X the PRODUCT(RED) treatment. The release of PRODUCT(RED) iPhones is bittersweet. Sure; they look really cool; but the spiffy red color doesn’t necessarily warrant waiting months to upgrade. If you like PRODUCT(RED) devices but didn’t want to wait for one; you might be tempted to buy your device a second time when the PRODUCT(RED) version finally hits shelves. Delaying PRODUCT(RED) releases feels like a last ditch effort to boost iPhone sales before everyone becomes fixated on the next model. I can only think of one real reason why Apple didn’t just release the PRODUCT(RED) iPhone 8s at the time of the iPhone 8 launch. Delaying PRODUCT(RED) releases feels like a last ditch effort by Apple to boost iPhone sales before everyone becomes fixated on the next generation that’s right around the corner. The omission of the iPhone X from the PRODUCT(RED) lineup was leaked in advance; so while it wasn’t really a surprise; the exlusion was a huge oversight on Apple’s part; not to mention a missed opportunity. With a portion of proceeds from each PRODUCT(RED) purchase being donated to a great cause; it probably would’ve pushed some iPhone X holdouts over the edge; however; since the iPhone X was more expensive to manufacture; it’s likely Apple probably didn’t want (RED) donations eating into their per-unit revenue. AirPlay 2 (May 2018) Photo courtesy of Apple Again; I want to give credit where credit is due; and the long-awaited AirPlay 2 was a highlight of 2018. AirPlay is Apple’s proprietary wireless technology for streaming media between Apple devices. Traditionally; AirPlay was designed for use with music; video; and gaming; but there were inherent limitations — particularly regarding latency and a general lack of utility— that restricted AirPlay’s usefulness. Originally intended to be baked into iOS 11; AirPlay 2 was delayed so Apple could further refine HomePod and its multi-room audio capabilities. Originally intended to be baked into iOS 11; AirPlay 2 was delayed so Apple could spend more time refining the HomePod and fine-tuning its multi-room audio capabilities. Then AirPlay 2 was finally released in May 2018; which was mere days before the first beta of iOS 12 was unveiled. When it was finally released; AirPlay 2 was a welcome improvement and delivery on promises that had been made since before iOS 11. [Side note: As mentioned previously; AirPlay 2 was designed with the HomePod in mind since it allows you to connect two HomePods simultaneously for stereo sound.] WWDC (June 2018) Photo courtesy of Apple In terms of hardware; Apple played it close to the vest at WWDC 2018 in June. Of course; WWDC is a software-focused event; so Apple took the opportunity to unveil software that would pave the way for the remainder of the year. Most of Apple’s WWDC coverage was positive; especially when it came to iOS; tvOS; and macOS. On the mobile side; Apple was universally praised for the work that went into iOS 12. Of course; the company really needed this win to help weather a pretty serious storm. In late 2017; users discovered their older iPhones were getting throttled; meaning processor performance was intentionally reduced. Amidst accusations of planned obsolescence — in other words; intentionally slowing down older phones; which essentially forces users to buy new devices — Apple said the purpose of doing this was actually to maintain user experience. According to Apple; iPhones with old batteries could experience random shutdowns if their processors continue maxing their respective clock speeds. So Apple quietly lowered those processors’ performance caps. In hindsight; the fact that Apple wasn’t transparent with the practice of limited processor speeds on older iPhone devices is surely what rubbed users the wrong way. Then iOS 12 came into the picture. Both the industry and consumers were extremely impressed with what Apple delivered in iOS 12. The company reportedly dedicated a ton of resources to this version of iOS so it would work exceptionally well on older devices. Suddenly; older iPhones like the iPhone 5S and iPhone 6 had new life. [Side note: It’s very possible — perhaps even likely — that the performance improvements iOS 12 brought to older iPhones contributed to the lackluster sales of 2018 iPhones; too.] With both Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos support; Apple TV 4K is competitive and ideal for home theater setups. Though it shipped with Dolby Vision support; Apple TV 4K notably lacked Dolby Atmos support. Fortunately; tvOS 12 rectified this omission by bringing support for both Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos. In turn; Apple TV 4K has become much more competitive among streaming hardware and is particularly appealing to home theater connoisseurs. For the Mac; Apple unveiled macOS 10.14 Mojave; which notably brought system-wide dark mode — for which users had long been begging — to macOS for the first time. There were a slew of other additions and improvements besides dark mode; too; in particular; Mojave brings a revamped App Store; a new Home app; and dozens of welcome quality-of-life changes. MacBook Pro (July 2018) Photo courtesy of LAPTOP Since the first Touchbar-sporting MacBrook Pros launched in 2016; Apple has released a new MacBook Pro each year. I personally think it’s because the MacBook Pro is one of Apple’s best-selling personal computing device — though I don’t currently have concrete numbers to verify this — so it behooves the company to keep the people buying these uber-expensive powerbooks happy. The 2016 MacBook Pro received mixed reactions. Though the design and build quality were praised (which is typical for Apple products); the MacBook Pro 2016 lost all I/O but a couple USB C ports; forcing buyers — largely professionals and power users who probably relied on all those ports — to adjust to “dongle life.” Then there’s the fact that the new MacBook Pro was technically outdated at launch; built on sixth-generation processors while competitors were offering the newer seventh-gen Intel “Kaby Lake” chipsets. In 2017; Apple addressed this gripe by updating the MacBook Pro again; offering the Kaby Lake chips to further boost the notebook’s power. So after last refreshing the MacBook Pro in 2012; we got two consecutive updates in 2016 and 2017. Apple has set a precedent for annual MacBook Pro updates; which could make it harder for consumers to buy a new MacBook Pro since a better model is always within reach. That’s why it was so surprising for Apple to update the MacBook Pro again at the tail end of July 2018. On the one hand; Apple has set a precedent for annual MacBook Pro updates; so we shouldn’t be surprised when it happens in 2019. On the other hand; these annual upgrades make it harder to buy a new MacBook Pro because you’re never more than 12 months from an even better version. And a MacBook Pro is no small investment. In the positive column; the MacBook Pro 2018 features Intel’s eighth-generation processor; so it’s an even better workhorse for anyone who needs power on the go. Specifically; this new MacBook Pro is great for graphic design; video editing; music production; and other intensive tasks. MacBook Pro 2018 features Apple’s T2 security chip. This is the first time Apple has put their own custom silicon in a Mac. The new MacBook Pro also features Apple’s T2 chip; which is an important moment in tech history as this is the first time Apple’s has put their own silicon in a Mac. Granted; the T2 chip deals primarily with security and biometric authentication via the TouchID sensor; so it’s not as exciting as; say; Apple’s A4 chip was in 2010. But when you consider the huge lead Apple has gained in smartphone performance by producing their own mobile processors; it’ll be interesting to see how long it takes for Apple to start making processors for their laptops and desktops in-house. Other new features added to the 2018 MacBook Pro include TrueTone display and native Siri support. You may recall that TrueTone debuted on the iPhone X; allowing for on-the-fly display recalibration that adjusts to the color temperature of your environment. Then Siri is… well; Siri; but now the MacBook Pro has support for “Hey Siri” just like an iPhone or iPad. Beyond the obligatory processor upgrade; the inclusion of Apple’s T2 chip; and a couple software tweaks here or there; the 2018 MacBook Pro was simply a slightly-improved version of the 2017 MacBook Pro. If the spec bump wouldn’t yield noticeable improvements in your workflow — which; again; is probably only significant for video editing and other intensive processes — the MacBook Pro 2018 probably isn’t all that exciting for most people. iPhone XS & iPhone XR (September 2018) Photo courtesy of Apple As in previous years; Apple kicked off the fall season with the company’s annual iPhone event at the Steve Jobs Theater on the new Cupertino campus. Whatever Apple planned to release in 2018 was inevitably going to pale in comparison to the iPhone X. To be fair; there really wasn’t much Apple could’ve done to top the iPhone X from the previous year. With 2018 being an “S” year; meaning incremental upgrades with largely the same form factor; whatever Apple was planning to release would inevitably pale in comparison to the hype and excitement that had surrounded the iPhone X. In the months leading to the event; numerous leaks spoiled those revelations. News of three iPhone models had been making the rounds; two of those iPhones were direct successors to the iPhone X; one with the same 5.8-inch OLED display and one with a larger 6.5-inch OLED display. The third device was the hotly-anticipated budget version of the iPhone X. Nobody could be certain what it would be called; but it was pegged to land in-between the two iPhone X successors in terms of screen size; sporting a 6.1-inch (likely LCD) display. Sure enough; at the event on September 12; Apple unveiled the iPhone XS; iPhone XS Max; and the iPhone XR with the latter being the budget-conscious version marketed as “the new generation of iPhone.” Unfortunately; the price hikes of 2017 continued in 2018. The iPhone XS had the same starting price of the iPhone X at $999 in the US. If you wanted the bigger version; the starting price was $1099 and could climb as high as $1;449 for 512 GB of storage. The iPhone XR seemed cheap by comparison even though its starting price of $749 was already higher than mid-range Android phones like the OnePlus 6 ($529). All three of the 2018 iPhones featured the buttonless; FaceID-centric design that debuted with the iPhone X; eliminating the design language that debuted with the iPhone 6. Additionally; all three models features the same impressive A12 Bionic processor; meaning that you’re getting the same industry-leading power no matter the price tier you choose. The general public had several key issues with the 2018 iPhones. First; there’s the price creep. With the smartphone industry as a whole tending to follow Apple’s lead; smartphones hitting or even surpassing the $1;000 price point is becoming disturbingly common in the wake of the iPhone X. Then there’s the fact that none of the 2018 iPhones have TouchID fingerprint sensors; which had been a popular iPhone feature since the iPhone 5S debuted in 2013. TouchID wasn’t just fast; it was familiar. Apple should’ve had at least one transitional generation of iPhone that offered both TouchID and FaceID instead of immediately forcing FaceID’s learning curve onto buyers. It’s one thing to eliminate the fingerprint sensor in favor of facial recognition on a device that’s intentionally experimental like the iPhone X; however; it would have been smart to have at least one generation of transitional iPhone that offered both TouchID and FaceID instead of pulling the rug out from beneath buyers; forcing the slight learning curve of a brand new security method onto them. Having controversially discontinued the iPhone SE; iPhone XR might’ve been Apple’s saving grace if the device hadn’t started on the wrong foot. In particular; the iPhone XR’s display — an 828 x 1792 “Liquid Retina” LCD at 326 pixels per inch (PPI) — was considered by the majority of critics and tech journalists to be way too low for a 2018 flagship; and nearly as much of a deal-breaker for prospective buyers as the high cost of the iPhone XS and XS Max. Though many tech critics and reviewers would come to praise the iPhone XR and its display once they got their hands on the device; it’s likely the damage had already been done. It left users with two choices: Pony up for thousand-dollar iPhones or hang onto their previous-generation iPhones. If reports from Apple’s supply chain are any indication; a lot of people chose the latter. Apple Watch Series 4 (September 2018) Photo courtesy of Apple Alongside the new iPhones launched at the fall event; Apple introduced what could be considered Apple’s “sleeper hit” of 2018: the Apple Watch Series 4. Apple Watch has long been the gold standard for wearables; and it’s only gotten better with each generation. With the Series 4; Apple flexed its muscles; making a great product even better — and; more specifically; even more relevant — by adding some pretty groundbreaking health features. The new Apple Watch has a feature called “fall detection;” which is exactly what it sounds like. If the person wearing the watch takes a serious spill; the watch will give that person the ability to easily call for emergency services. Besides the fall detection; the Apple Watch Series 4 also brings electrocardiograph (ECG) capabilities to a wearable device for the first time. It’s works pretty brilliantly: Just put your finger on the watch’s digital crown to “close the circuit” and allow the Apple Watch to read your heart rhythm. Apple Watch Series 4 has become a legitimate medical diagnostic device. On paper; this makes the Apple Watch Series 4 a legitimate medical diagnostic device that will determine which type of heart rhythm you have and could; in theory; detect a condition like atrial fibrillation. Looking back; the Apple Watch Series 4 is arguably one of Apple’s strongest products of the year. If it weren’t for wearables being practically passé at this point; the Apple Watch Series 4 would’ve been a much bigger seller. iPad Pro (November 2018) Photo courtesy of Apple But wait; there’s more. As we neared the holiday season; Apple announced the next-generation iPad Pro to mixed reactions. There’s no denying the new iPad Pro is a capable device. With slimmed bezels; FaceID; and a new utilitarian design language that’s reminiscent of the iPhone 5 era of Apple design; the new iPad Pro is inarguably the most powerful tablet on the market. Benchmarks have shown the A12X Bionic chip in the 2018 iPad Pro shatters records; raising the bar in terms of how much power a tablet computer can offer. And it’s not just the single-core scores impressive; the iPad Pro’s multi-core benchmarks rival even high-end laptop computers. There are two major problems with the iPad Pro 2018: price and the inherent limitations of iOS. So what’s the problem? Well; there are two. First; the iPad Pro is held back by the high cost. At a starting price of $799; the cost of the iPad Pro is comparable to what you could pay for a similarly-specced Windows laptop. It comes down to this: Who’s going to pay $800 or more for a tablet? If you’re hoping for the iPad Pro to be a productivity machine; you’ll have to throw down some serious cash: The Apple Pencil; which is basically a required accessory to really get the most out of the iPad Pro; also got a second generation with an accompanying price hike. Whereas it previously cost $99; the second-generation Apple Pencil retails for $129. Adding a keyboard; case; and the new Apple Pencil (because the first-gen Pencil won’t work with the new iPad Pro) to a 12.9-inch Wifi-only 64 GB iPad Pro; you’re looking at investing well over $1;200. For a tablet. But if you want to get a higher storage option; you’re easily crossing into MacBook Pro price territory. And don’t even get me started on the fact that the new iPad Pro doesn’t work with the first-generation Apple Pencil; Apple is strong-arming you into buying the newer and needlessly more expensive expensive version. The other major issue holding the iPad Pro back is iOS. Even with the industry-leading benchmarks; all that power is for nought if the operating system doesn’t let you to harness that power or take advantage of it in meaningful ways. As it stands; the iPhone’s mobile operating system just isn’t robust enough to take full advantage of the iPad Pro’s incredibly processing power. Plus; in the absence of support for external storage devices; a decent file management system; and support for desktop-class applications; the iPad Pro remains essentially a glorified media and web browsing machine. Assuming there are apps available to give you the functionality needed to be truly productive on the iPad Pro; again; you’re paying nearly the same cost as a decently-specced MacBook Pro; so what’s the point? The 2018 iPad Pro ended up being a powerful tablet that everyone would love to own and play with; but few can justify its price. There are just a few particular instances when an iPad Pro is a reasonable purchase; for instance; there’s a lot here for illustrators and artists to love. Otherwise; the iPad Pro serves as clear indication of how the future of computing isn’t quite ready to become our present. Mac Mini (November 2018) Photo courtesy of Apple It was a long time coming; but Apple finally updated its lowest-cost Apple PC. And yes; the price of the Mac Mini increased; too. Before November 2018; Apple had last shown the Mac Mini love in 2014. Among its Mac lineup; the Mini was conceptualized as a budget-friendly; lower-powered option; ideal for home servers; as family PCs; or for less demanding tasks. But after four years; Mac Mini could no longer keep up. The new Mac Mini is a modern entry-level desktop in almost every sense of the word. Updated with Apple’s Thunderbolt USB-C ports and an optional 10-gigabit ethernet port; the Mini checks most boxes that are essential in 2019; bringing the miniaturized desktop up to snuff with competitors. At its unveiling; the new Mac Mini was a welcome improvement; but it hasn’t been without its problems. Apple has made the Mini non-user-upgradeable; which continues to be a point of contention for users. But Apple has thrown users a bone: It is technically possible to upgrade the RAM or SSD in your Mac Mini; but it has to be done by a technician at your nearest Apple Store. If you were hoping to use a Mac Mini for video editing; gaming; or other intensive tasks; you’ll probably need an external GPU. If you had hoped to use a Mini in lieu of an iMac for video editing; gaming; or other intensive tasks; be aware that the Mac Mini’s GPU is pretty lackluster. You’ll probably be shopping for an external GPU sooner than later. Perhaps the most controversial move was the price hike; a common refrain in 2018. Whereas the Mac Mini previously started at an entry-friendly price of $499; the 2018 Mac Mini starts at $799; which is an increase of nearly 40 percent. Admittedly; it’s not terrible value for what you’re getting; but the increased price puts it within throwing distance of more capable; powerful hardware like the MacBook Pro. So if you’re planning on getting a Mini and even considering upgrading its specs; you’re probably better off skipping the Mini altogether and getting a base model MacBook Pro or iMac that’s simply more capable. Summary It’s clear that 2018 was a pretty rough year for Apple overall. The products — and the hardware in particular — Apple released throughout 2018 are great; but with the prices ballooning year over year; Apple needs to step back and really reconsider what kind of value these devices are bringing. Is it enough to warrant such high costs? Beyond the lackluster iPhone releases and the controversial HomePod; we’re still waiting for AirPower; the wireless charging pad announced during the iPhone X event in 2017 and originally slated for a 2018 release. We’re also still waiting for a follow-up to the Apple’s extremely popular AirPods. But there have been some wins; too. iOS 12 is more polished and capable than ever. The Apple Watch Series 4 is literally saving lives. The iPad Pro 2018 is posting benchmarks many laptops can only dream of hitting. Apple took buyers for granted; failing to provide compelling reasons or incentive to invest in new products. Unfortunately; most consumers don’t care about these landmark achievements; and Apple took for granted that the newest shiny toy with the Apple logo on it would be enough to buy. With most of Apple’s 2018 product releases; the problem is that Apple isn’t providing compelling reasons or incentive for consumers to buy new models instead of keeping what they already have. For 2019; I’d like to see Apple rein in the price hikes; it’s getting to the point where it’s hard to recommend Apple’s incredible products when the pricing is obscene and turns most people off buying new Apple products altogether. Moreover; I’d like to see Apple do something unique with the 2019 iPhones; something to renew excitement for Apple and re-secure its position at the front of the technology pack.

Og — selvfølgelig skjedde det … 2412 ting i React-verdenen! <ForrigeUke /> er en artikkelserie som oppsummerer hva som skjedde i React-økosystemet i uken som var (og i denne spesialutgaven; de to siste ukene). Julestemning for dayz. Bilde av rawpixel på Unsplash React-året oppsummert Jeg hadde egentlig tenkt å skrive noe lignende selv; men Harry Wolff slo meg på målstreken. Unge herr Wolff har skrevet en flott oppsummering av de største eventsa i React-året 2018; som er tilgjengelig både i video- og tekstform. React Year in Review 2018 Hello everyone! Welcome to my React Year in Review 2018! React's 2018 was one of steady growth and doubling down on… hswolff.com Det var selvfølgelig haugevis av andre ting som skjedde i år også; og du kan finne mesteparten av dem ved å lese deg gjennom resten av årets <ForrigeUke />-er: Alle innslag av <ForrigeUke /> blogg.bekk.no Møt Revel Carlberg West 🙋‍♀️ Blir du også av og til litt sjokkert over hvor unge noen av disse superstjerne-utviklerne vi ofte tillegger så mye kunnskap er? James Kyle (kjent fra Parcel; Babel etc) er 25; Ives van Hoorne (skaperen av CodeSandbox) er 22; og Dan Abramov er 26 (!). Vel; jeg har litt dårlige nyheter til deg. Revel er en 9 år gammel gutt som elsker React; og som akkurat holdt sin første talk på React NYC Meetup! Her prater han om hooks som en sjef; og er full av flotte sitat og kunnskap! Jeg tror ikke jeg kunne vært så rolig foran så mange mennesker! Se talken under; og følg han på Twitter-kontoen hans (kurert av faren hans). Litt trøst for impostor syndromet ditt Føler du også på at alle kan alt; og at du kan ingenting? Velkommen i klubben. Få bransjer beveger seg like fort; med like mange deleglade profesjonelle som IT; og det er lett å få inntrykk av at mengden man må kunne for å i det hele tatt føle seg som en middels vellykket utvikler; er helt uangripelig. Heldigvis er det en kollektiv løgn. Du er flink — og du blir flinkere for hver dag som går! Hvis du ikke er sikker på sistnevnte — se på kode du skrev for 6 måneder siden. 🙈 Dan Abramov er en kjekk kar som halve internett (undertegnede inkludert) evangeliserer som en slags superstjerne. Da er det ekstra godt å føle på at selv Danny Dan ikke kan alt — og at det er okei! Han har nemlig skrevet en flott artikkel der han nevner en del ting han selv ikke er veldig komfortabel med. Artikkelen påstår basically at det er naturlig å ha visse gap i kunnskapen sin; og at man ikke trenger å kunne alt i et fagfelt for å kunne bidra med faktisk verdi. Videre prater han om sine egne kunnskapsgap. Things I Don't Know as of 2018 December 28; 2018 * ☕️ 5 min read People often assume that I know far more than I actually do. That's not a bad problem… overreacted.io Nytt på byggfronten Mens vi har lagt på oss noen kilo i romjulen; har både Parcel; Webpack og Rollup lagt på seg en major (eller begynt å nærme seg en; i alle fall). Webpack 5 er i alpha! Den mest brukte bundleren på markedet — webpack — er på vei ut i ny versjon; og allerede godt i gang med alpha-testingen. Changeloggen er full av nyheter; hvor blant annet persistert caching (les: kjemperaske bygg) og såkalt hot module replacing for flere filtyper er blant de store nyhetene. Parcel sniker seg innpå v2 Det er mange som gleder seg til den komplette redesignen av zero-config bundleren Parcel kommer ut; men den rakk dessverre ikke helt ut i 2018. Det den rakk var dog en ny minor-versjon — 1.11.0 — som blant annet inneholder HMR-støtte for Elm; samt Kotlin-støtte. I tillegg har man begynt å ta i bruk endel pakker fra Parcel 2 — så man unngår de aller største oppgraderingskostnadene! Rollup ute i 1.0.0! Rollup er den foretrukne bundleren for pakker i React-økosystemet; og har endelig blitt sluppet i sin første major! Du kan sjekke changeloggen for en å se hvilke breaking changes som treffer deg; men i all hovedsak så er det støtte for code-splitting som er den store nyheten her. Nå kan biblioteker kanskje splittes opp i forskjellige bundles; basert på bruksmønster? Mulighetene er ganske enorme! 50 beste React-artiklene fra 2018 Det er en tjeneste som heter Mybridge ; som bruker kunstig intelligens til å kompilere lister over de “beste” artiklene i en gitt kategori.

Internet of Things — shaping our future today,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write Internet of Things — shaping our future today Natasha F Saxberg · Follow 3 min read · Jan 2; 2019 -- 1 Internet of Things (IoT) is a well known buzzword; many people might have heard about for a couple of decades. At same time it can be difficult to understanding what IoT actually covers and how far it is from our mass reality. IoT covers a paradigm of technologies; platforms; and industry solutions. The basic definition of IoT is connecting any- “thing” to each other and/or the Internet. This will potentially affect any object in our lives; since everything that makes sense to connect will be connected. From our leisure time to our professional setting; anything from cars; jet engines and door locks to your shoes will consist of input/output. It is already a reality. EVERYTHING THAT MAKES SENSE TO CONNECT WILL BE CONNECTED. Industry experts give competing estimates on the number of IoT devices in the future; from 20 to more than 150 billion devices in 2020. As with all other technology; the key interaction will be human; since IoT objects will not only be connected to things; but to people. Whether we use big data and artificial intelligence to make better decisions; remotely control a robot; perform heart surgery in a refugee camp; or customise our physical environment through mixed reality. While broadband Internet has become more widely available; smartphone penetration is sky-rocketing. The worldwide smartphone market will reach a total of 1.5 billion units shipped in 2016; up 5.7% from the 1.4 billion units shipped in 2015. From there; shipments will reach 1.92 billion units in 2020. And the cost of connecting people and objects is constantly decreasing; enabling the perfect storm for Internet in Things. INTERNET OF THINGS WILL NOT ONLY CHANGE HOW TECHNOLOGY AFFECTS HUMANS; BUT ENFORCE A CHANGE IN MOST POWER STRUCTURES AS WE KNOW THEM; FROM DEMOCRACY TO AUTHORITY. Through 4;5/5G and IPv6 we are entering a reality where the world will consist of a giant network of connected “things”; shaping the future of work; facilities; and megacities. In this era; we will not only see a change in our use of technology; but in most of the structures and organisations; we know today. We will need a systemic upgrade to support our exponentially intelligent future; from the power structures of politics; democracy; and geographical borders to how we educate and the future of organisations. THE IOT STACK IoT is not only technology; but a paradigm; from protocols; hardware to software. To understand IoT; one must understand the IoT Stack; and the maturity of the layers. This Thing Stack consists of three layers: sensors; microcontrollers and internet connectivity; and service platforms. Sensors are embedded in objects or the physical environment to capture information and events for your company. Microcontrollers and internet connectivity share information captured by sensors within your IoT objects and act based on this information to change the environment. Through aggregation and analysis of data; service platforms cater to your customers. The platforms also control your IoT product’s end-to-end experience; enable your customers to define system rules and update firmware. The defintion of IoT is the use of intelligently connected devices and systems that can leverage data gathered by embedded sensors and operators in machines and other physical objects. In other word things that can connect and process data connected with a network. As an example a pen with a RFID tag is not IoT; because it does not connect to anything and it does not process data — it can be used as an element in an IoT solution but more intelligence is needed to be captured under the IoT umbrella. IOT WILL CHANGE OUR WORLD The world as we know it today will change dramatically; and we all play an essential part in cultivating this future as business professionals whether we work with startups; corporations or in the public sector. I will publish a series on future scenarios of IoT; how leading innovators and companies are developing IoT solutions affecting us now as well as in the future; to inspire others who are working with emerging technologies and/or who also possess a curious mind.

Innovation Elevation: A Myth and Some Initial Observations by Isa Lacuna,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write Innovation Elevation: A Myth and Some Initial Observations by Isa Lacuna Shiela Manalo · Follow Published in John Clements Lookingglass · 7 min read · Jan 1; 2019 “A Klee painting named Angelus Novus shows an angel looking as though he is about to move away from something he is fixedly contemplating. His eyes are staring; his mouth is open; his wings are spread. This is how one pictures the angel of history. His face is turned toward the past. Where we perceive a chain of events; he sees one single catastrophe which keeps piling wreckage upon wreckage and hurls it in front of his feet. The angel would like to stay; awaken the dead; and make whole what has been smashed. But a storm is blowing from Paradise; it has got caught in his wings with such violence that the angel can no longer close them. The storm irresistibly propels him into the future to which his back is turned; while the pile of debris before him grows skyward. This storm is what we call progress.” - Walter Benjamin; Theses on the Philosophy of History I am hesitant to talk about “innovation” or any kind of so-called “elevation” of the term (as the theme insists; as the theme presupposes; as the theme vehemently desires) because the word is; in my osmotic understanding of the popular imagination; aggressively optimistic and naively utopic to a fault in daily use. Before; when I was still in advertising; the rallying call was always to innovate (products; mediums; taglines; points-of-purchase; packaging designs; greeting cards; literally everything we had to work on) because it is supposedly the only manner by which businesses can stay afloat and through which advertising can ‘somehow’ disseminate the never-before articulated insights of national consciousness across a whole host of massive media outlets and endless commercial seasons. Simply put; everyone is being charged with the responsibility to innovate; ceaselessly and relentlessly; across all disciplines and all positions; and part of my reluctance regarding this whole endeavor of talking about it stems from the fact that for the past few years; I and the people I work with have done nothing but talk about and be governed by the concept of innovation; to the point that not only has it become nonsensical; in the way that any word gets when it is repeated incessantly; automatically; and fervently; but also tortuous in its endlessness. As a Philippine radio station ID constantly belts out; in monotonous succession: “What is the meaning of this?”¹ One can start answering that question etymologically. Innovation as a word emerged in the mid-sixteenth century; from the Latin innovat- ‘renewed; altered’ from the verb innovare; from in- ‘into’ + novare ‘make new’ (from novus ‘new’).² Interestingly; it was first used as a kind of invective; one hurled at heretical troublemakers who refused to follow the religious doctrine held sacred by sixteenth to seventeenth century Puritans.³ The logic seems to be that one could never hope to be a good person if one was always trying to break biblical rules; and that carried a lot of weight in a European setting where people were; contextually; undergoing massive upheavals both in their religious and political structures. It was a combination of the scientific turn; the Industrial Revolution; and the rise of capitalism which redeemed “innovation” from the bottom of the metaphorical trash heap moralism had buried it in and polished it with a veneer of progressiveness. Specifically; Austrian economist Joseph Schumpeter “defined invention as an act of intellectual creativity undertaken without any thought given to its possible economic import; while innovation happens when firms figure out how to craft inventions into constructive changes in their business model.”⁴ From here; economics becomes the key feature which differentiates the term from creative invention; and up until now; we still operate under the same assumption. Innovation is pointless if it does not generate some kind of profit; because then it would be similar to art; which; while uplifting; is not financially remunerative. Or; if you would like to state it in another way; you’ll find it difficult to come across anyone willing to pay you for your art; but you’ll always find someone willing to pay you if you promise them innovation. Fast forward to 1991; wherein Fredric Jameson described innovation as not only characteristic of the postmodern condition; but also as one of the beliefs that alienates us from the history of the world. “The frantic economic urgency of producing fresh waves of ever more novel-seeming goods (from clothing to airplanes); at ever greater rates of turnover; now assigns an increasingly essential structural function and position to aesthetic innovation and experimentation . . . We now inhabit the synchronic rather than the diachronic; and I think it is at least empirically arguable that our daily life; our psychic experience; our cultural languages; are today dominated by categories of space rather than by categories of time . . .”⁵ In other words; there really is nothing new about the new; or the way we think about the new. In fact; we have become so used to the concept that we live in a state where it is constantly commodified to the point that is an expectation of the everyday. Jameson’s propositions mirror the mood illustrated by Walter Benjamin’s writing on Angelus Novus; which is quoted in the very beginning of this essay. While there are some dissimilarities with regard to how they envision the shape and function of history — from Benjamin’s single catastrophe to Jameson’s ironic alternatives — both nevertheless believe that innovation without history can only produce a future more bereft; more intolerable; and more alienated to real human conditions; than the present that births it. Where does this leave us then; on the question of innovation and its supposed elevation? Let me propose some initial observations; which I hope might be food for thought in at least the next few moments: First; that as a concept; innovation has been regurgitating its own logic since the 1800s; therefore; there’s nothing really innovative about it. All of its functions; its strategies; and its consequent maneuvers; have been apparent centuries ago; but its genius lies in the way that we continue to fall for the utopic myth it has been made to represent.⁶ If one would like to “elevate” the idea of innovation (elevate; from the Latin elevat- ‘raised’; from the verb elevare — from e- (variant of ex-) ‘out; away’ + levare ‘lighten’ (from levis ‘light’)⁷; then one must first grapple with the fact that historically; nineteenth century businessmen have already “raised” the idea. Innovation is already a cultural dominant; and you would be hard pressed to find a concept more favored; or more generative of interest from all business sectors. One needs to ask; what are we elevating innovation from; and is it even necessary at this point? Innovation is already the star of the show and the world is its captive audience; what more can we possibly do for it; and does it really need to be magnified even more? Second; and implicit to this whole argument is the function of history and the genealogy of ideas. Echoing Jameson; the way we work has blurred temporal categories so much so that it seems like we are living in an eternal present; willing to deny the function of history in our everyday lives. Ahistoricity; while easy to appropriate; is riddled with ignorance and only produces short-term successes and a whole host of invisible long-term failures. Innovation; which I do not doubt must still be delivered at the end of the day; no matter how suspicious I might be of the idea; can only benefit from analyses with a longue durée in mind. Whether we are talking about the innovation of a product; a campaign; a marketing strategy; or like this article somewhat hastily attempts; the innovation of innovation itself; the capacity to think about an object as a product of time can only be generative of insight; which is a rare but truly beautiful thing nowadays. So if there is any piece of advice I can only hope to propose and with which to end this article with; it is that one try to think of things historically; in as many ways as one can. While this project might not guarantee you financial and material compensation; it does provide; in a way; a kind of personal elevation. ¹ Supposedly the punchline to a series of running gags featured on the popular Philippine FM station; 101.1 Yes FM; in the Philippines. On a good day; sometimes the joke will be funny. On a bad day; there will be no joke; only the punchline on repeat; which might be its own joke altogether. ² English Oxford Living Dictionaries; s.v. “innovate.” https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/us/innovate ³ Emma Green; “Innovation: The History of a Buzzword;” The Atlantic; June 20; 2013. https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2013/06/innovation-the-history-of-a-buzzword/277067/ ⁴ Ibid. ⁵ Fredric Jameson; “The Logic of Late Capitalism;” in Postmodernism; or; the Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism (Durham: Duke University Press; 1991); 4; 16. ⁶ This point does not attempt to detract from the myriad number of ways innovation continues to have a function in our lives. Take for example; the rise of the internet and the way it has redefined our conception of work. The digital network is still a product of late capital; it is still mainly a function of our desire to reap more profit by collapsing our ideas of time and space (everything should be quicker; faster; and should have a more global reach; etcetera etcetera); but definitely the paradigms by which we enact this logic are not similar to the those lived by seventeenth century peasants; the monarchists; the industrialists; or the other numerous historical demographics that have either risen or fallen in the past two centuries. ⁷ English Oxford Living Dictionaries; s.v. “elevate.” https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/us/elevate.

Taking back the control,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write Taking back the control Siddarth Kengadaran · Follow Published in Siddarth Kengadaran · 2 min read · Jan 1; 2019 57 Great technology should improve life; not distract from it. It was 11 years ago when I first got my mobile phone. Mobile phones have evolved in so many ways in this 11 years from monochrome graphics to 16M colored OLED touchscreen. As they have moved from a product of luxury to a product of necessity; it has changed the way we buy things; communicate with people; eat; work and also what we do; how we think; what we focus on and our habits because technology is evolving faster than we are! Mobile phones haven’t just impacted the lives of individuals but at large as a society. With the increase in problems such as social comparison; self-comparison; fear of missing out; smartphone zombie; decreased attention; shortness of temper; sleep disorders; depression etc.; we can’t just stop using mobile phones but we can control how we use them rather than diving into the infinity pool. Few things which have worked for me and which can help you to gain back the control; 1) Uninstall all the applications which takes your time unnecessarily (infinity pool) instead use them on the computer when you have real necessity or on a mobile browser; atleast there is a resistance. 2) Disable lock screen notifications. 3) Disable notifications from apps which don’t need your immediate attention. 4) Set up wind down time for your sleep routine. 5) Don’t check your phone first thing in the morning. 6) Leave your phone in a different room or far from reach when you want to concentrate on a piece of work. 7) Monitor your app usage; both iOS (Screen Time) and Android (Digital Wellbeing) have dashboards to monitor your app usage. 8) Stop being reactive These are just a few tricks which have helped me which I am trying to master. If you have any other ideas or tricks do share! Let’s build a future where technology stands behind and life stands ahead Wishing you a very happy and focused new year 2019!

Big Ideas for 2019 and beyond,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write Image credit: Mohamed Hassan Big Ideas for 2019 and beyond What are you looking forward to in 2019? Andre Podnozov · Follow Published in Predict · 5 min read · Jan 2; 2019 81 LinkedIn approached me about expressing my views on what will be the Big Ideas of 2019; in a similar vein to their prediction piece. So I came up with my own list; except these are not predictions per se — after all; I’m no shaman and I can’t see the future. Instead; the ideas on this list — they are simply in the air and I’m only channeling them. Some of these ideas will materialize in 2019; whereas other ones are clearly long-term and they will play out over the course of years if not decades. 1. Re-shoring and vertical integration With de-globalization picking up steam; deeper economies of scale are becoming increasingly unsustainable. This presents companies with a challenge and an opportunity at the same time. The challenge is that they have to bring additional portions of manufacturing chain in-house. On the other hand; it gives companies the opportunity to ensure excellent end-to-end user experience with their products. Of recent examples; Tesla has been masterful in using vertical integration to its advantage. But the big-picture benefit here is growing re-industrialization and diversity of domestic manufacturing capabilities; which will have very positive long-term effect on many aspects of life: from improved standard of living for the population as a whole; to strengthened geopolitical position of the country. 2. Advanced technologies struggling in the market In another consequence of fragmenting global markets; the pace of innovation is slowing down; especially in the R&D-intensive areas. Just see how much difficulty Intel is having with their 10nm products. Another example is advanced display technologies. Currently the buzz is hot around flexible displays: folding phones and roll-up TV screens. While technical feasibility of such products exists; their high prices will not likely be conducive to wide-spread market success; especially in the climate of decreasing consumer purchasing power; tied to projected economic downturn of 2019. I mean; how many flat-screen TVs does a reasonable person need in every room; including bathrooms? That’s not to say that advanced research should not be done; however it would have to be re-angled from near-term commercial profitability to more strategic goals. 3. Rising prestige of science As the ancient wisdom says; nobody can enter the same river twice. By the same token; it’s not possible to carry out re-industrialization using last century technologies. In order for the economy to regain its industrial strength in the competitive landscape; we need a lot of breakthroughs in all areas of science. Unfortunately; core scientific fields are not as popular with American college students nowadays; compared to Business degrees for example. In fact; hard majors like Physics don’t even register in top-40 rankings; according to some studies. While the focus on STEM is gaining momentum; we still have ways to go before this society starts producing required amounts of scientific brainpower. How glorious will be the day when a PhD in Materials Science; for example; becomes more desirable than an MBA! 4. Big initiatives that inspire and unite It is high time for this country to set aside its disagreements and work together towards common goals. Some of these goals may be technological in nature; for example: spreading human civilization beyond planet Earth; while others may be focused on social progress; for example: eradicating poverty and hunger. Naturally; technology will be heavily involved in anything we do in this day and age; but that’s not the main point. Advanced modern technologies would allow this society to set such ambitious and worthy goals that the overwhelming majority of the population can get behind in full consciousness — this is the uniting factor. And these goals will actually be demonstrably achievable through the course of scientific progress; which will reinforce confidence in the initiatives. Could this be the foundation of the New American Dream? Because the old promise — that children live better than parents — does not hold true anymore. Just ask the millennials. 5. Social technologies for the people There is a lot of opportunity in using technology to further social goals. For example; the society would benefit from increased sense of trust between all participants. Alas; all the cat and dog videos crowding the social network feeds don’t go quite far enough towards building that sense of community. I look forward to new generation of social technologies that are aimed at bringing out the best in people; rather than monetizing the hours they spend in front of the screen. 6. Focus on Basic Needs and overwhelming end-user value I wrote a separate article on this; so I’ll just link to it rather than be repetitive: Basic Needs as a driver of the Next Industrial Revolution 7. Hype heading for the exit Ok; over-hyped technologies; you know who you are… yes I’m looking at you Blockchain. Well; if I were to be serious for a moment; commonly circulated decentralized money would have far-reaching consequences for our civilization because it would challenge the millennia-old status quo. And that’s exactly why this would never be allowed to happen — not until a major climate disruption in hell; I would think. In the meantime; the exaggerated amount of attention devoted to over-hyped technologies is distracting and counter-productive. It would be best to focus our collective energies on higher-priority goals. 8. Big guys getting bigger Big players tend to weather the trying times better than smaller companies. In the end of the day this allows the big guys to get even bigger — that’s the “last-man-standing” reward of sorts. Let’s take a specific example — cloud providers. At this point I think it’s safe to say that we will not have more than 3 cloud providers in the US anymore. We may even see this number starting to get reduced to 2. In closing Challenges and opportunities always go hand-in-hand; so let us enter 2019 with optimism and the best New Year wishes all-around!

Instagram TV: The Product I Most Recently Used That Took My Breath Away,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write Instagram TV: The Product I Most Recently Used That Took My Breath Away Rashaud Savage · Follow 4 min read · Jan 2; 2019 2 ** Note: As apart of KPCB’s Product Fellows Program application; I have been asked to describe “the last product you used that took [my] breath away.” ** Introduction In recent years; Instagram has grown considerably from an app that shares photos amongst friends into a social network where users can interact with friends and many different forms of media. A significant change that has happened recently is the introduction of Instagram TV (IGTV). IGTV was created as a long-form (less than an hour) video hub for videos longer than the 1- minute videos you may encounter in you normal instagram feed. It is also distinguished differently from the 10 second videos located in Instagram stories. IGTV is accessible from a button inside the Instagram home screen; as well as a standalone app; IGTV will spotlight popular videos from Instagram celebrities and creators. How IGTV Works IGTV enables anyone to be a creator; not just big-name celebrities. People can upload vertical videos through Instagram’s app or the web. Everyone except smaller and new accounts can upload hour-long videos immediately. The IGTV app is available globally on iOS and Android; as well as in the Instagram app through a TV shaped button above Stories. Viewers are able to swipe through a variety of longer-form videos; or swipe up to visit a browse tab of personally recommended videos; popular videos; creators they’re following and the option to continue watching previously started videos. Users also get callouts from the IGTV button alerting them to new content. IGTV lets creators develop Instagram Channels full of their different videos that people can subscribe to. Creators are also able to put links in the description of their videos to drive traffic to their other social presences; e-commerce stores or websites. Below is an 1 minute demo of IGTV. My Takeaway Instagram has created an opportunity to settle into a sweet spot between YouTube and Snapchat Discover. YouTube offers an incredible breadth of content; but it’s so packed with amateurish videos that it can be tough to find the gems. With algorithmic; personalized curation and a narrower set of sources; Instagram could raise the likelihood that users will like what they’re shown. That could encourage users to fill a 7- 10 minute Uber ride or 30-minute commute with Instagram’s long-form video platform rather than aimlessly wandering the web. On the other end of the spectrum; Snapchat has focused on heavy-handed curation for Discover; only working with chosen partners. But that means it can be tough to find something to watch that really resonates. The recent redesign drowns polished Discover video in rivers of friends’ Stories and semi-pro creators. And Snapchat has just 186 million daily users compared to the 500 million-plus Instagram has. That reach could lure in creators who want to build their brand and audience; as well as (although not finalized how) earn money from their content. I suggest that it take the form of pre-roll ads or mid-break commercials; with creators potentially earning a revenue share. This is all what Facebook was hoping to do with Facebook Watch; but that original video hub was filled with third-rate reality shows and documentaries that haven’t piqued the interest of the younger crowd. Facebook is a ubiquitous utility; but it’s certainly not cool any more (according to todays youth). It’s NBC. Here; Instagram has a chance to be the second coming of MTV but for the newer generation. As someone who aspires to be a product manager one day; I would love to meet with the team and the product manager behind IGTV. I strongly believe that IGTV is a success because it lives at the intersection of technology; creativity; and business. About the Author: Who am I? Rashaud Savage of course!

How to maximize the usage of your mobile data?,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write How to maximize the usage of your mobile data? Cindy Chuah · Follow 3 min read · Jan 1; 2019 -- Thrashing your mobile data every month? Good news to every mobile subscriber who has excess mobile data out there! Now; you have a choice! An international award winning start-up; Simplify; has launched a mobile app to let you sell your unutilized monthly mobile data bandwidth for cash. In its mission to make Internet more affordable and accessible; Simplify aims to rechannel unused Internet bandwidth for the needy. Remember; there are still 4 Billion people on the planet without Internet access. The company first launched its service in late 2016 and since be crowned two major accolades which includes being named as one of the Most Innovative Companies and Most Disruptive Business on the planet. Its notable use cases cover Grab drivers selling to passengers as an extra income; tour guides selling to foreign tourists who didn’t purchase a local SIM card or refused to turn on the expensive data roaming. Interestingly; Simplify tends to create a new sharing economy in the mobile broadband space to benefit 3 major segments of mobile users: 1) Unlimited data plan; 2) Mid-tier data plan with huge data quota; 3) Prepaid plan with very limited quota. If you fall under the first two categories; Simplify has the right solution for you to sell off your unused data bandwidth to subsidize your own mobile data plan! This app has created a win-win solution to the consumers: You sell your unused mobile data for cash; and buyers get to buy your data on a pay-as-you-go basis. Sellers can fix the rate they wish to sell; for example RM8/GB. Like Grab and AirBnB; Simplify will take 20% commission out of the total data revenue sold (p/s: the company needs it to maintain their server). No contract; no hidden cost; all you need is to sign up a PayPal account to start selling your unutilized bandwidth. All transactions are cashless. On top of that; connecting on Simplify is convenient as buyers are not required to key in any Wi-Fi password in order to access the Internet; as Simplify will connect you smartly on the fly. All you have to do is just to choose which connection has the strongest network strength; click it; and there you go! You’re connected. Fret not on the security of this app; because you are in safe hands of Simplify as the app double-encrypt your hotspot password in the phone; and it does not forward or store your Wi-Fi password on the cloud. Simplify takes security and privacy of their users as first priority. Smart; Seamless and Secure; as its name suggests; Simplify caters for convenience and security. Have you Simplify?

ABOUT SIMPLIFY Simplify; one of the World’s 50 Most Innovative Companies; creates a marketplace for users to buy and sell excess mobile data from their monthly plans; extending sharing economy to the mobile broadband space. Simplify enables sellers to set their data prices at a single touch and the service dynamically creates an encrypted hotspot password so buyers can seamlessly piggyback on another person’s internet access on the fly.

Haley Kirk_Design Thinking Exercise,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write Haley Kirk_Design Thinking Exercise Haley Kirk · Follow 4 min read · Jan 1; 2019 45 1 Whole Bank is transitioning from a conventional bank to a bank that puts tech and customer service at the center of its focus. In an ever more globalized economy; being able to give customers global solutions is no longer an option; it is a requisite. Whole Bank would like to take away the stress and lack of clarity that often comes with paying for things internationally. Whole Bank looks to do this while maintaining their high standards of personalized customer service. Our interviewees ranged from young professionals traveling on business and pleasure to retirees traveling for cultural experiences and family visits. Although their motives for travel and their spending habits varied; we found 5 similar topics arise in most interviews. Commissions; Fees; and Conversion Rates Credit Card Points; Rewards; and Benefits Card Accessibility and Vendor Acceptance Budgeting Robbery and Safety Most interviewees indicated that their biggest concern was avoiding extra fees and bad conversion rates while traveling. We decided to focus on this issue while creating an app design for Whole Bank. Client Interviews — Interviewees ranged from 25 to 65 years old. In each interview transcription we tallied common themes we saw emerging and aligned our focus with their top concerns. We brainstormed possible solutions for each pain point. We came up with several solutions to avoid extra fees and commissions. We focused on 2 specifically: Clarity regarding conversion rates of currency An easy way to compare different card fees and benefits side by side We created a process that quickly educates the consumer about the country’s conversion rate through a visual aid. From there; the consumer is brought to their digital wallet where they can see their various card providers at a glance. This was an important solution we thought we could easily incorporate as many consumers said card acceptance was an issue. We wanted consumers to easily be able to tell if their card was Visa; AMEX; Mastercard; etc. While in their wallet; the client can slide out a card to see the full card details or to make a payment. Each card will show details regarding fees; points; and conversion rates. Almost all interviewees indicated that they found it necessary to carry at least some cash on hand. For this reason we also included an ATM finder option. The ATM finder would work with Google Maps and show pins in green; yellow; or red depending on the ATM’s fees and conversion rate. One important comment from an interviewee was; “I like the personal attention I receive from my bank.” We wanted to ensure that consumers felt taken care of; even while using a mobile app. We tried to convey this sentiment through the tone of the copy and through the inclusion of a live chat that connects consumers to a bank representative. Initial Prototype — Our first prototype focused on educating the consumer through a visual display of currency conversion. From there; the customer is taken to their digital wallet where they can quickly see their cards and providers; as well as view a break down of the card’s pros and cons depending on the country they are traveling in. I found this challenge fun and also eye-opening. There were several key points I took away from the experience. 1. The prototyping process is much more involved than I expected! Realistically; my prototype needed to include many more screens. There were certain features that I did not draw out a screen for. For example; the button that indicated “€ -› $” would have “flipped” to show the digital wallet in the user’s home currency. 2. There are certain features that I don’t know how to communicate through a prototype sketch. I had many features that in my mind seemed intuitive but I wasn’t really sure how to communicate them on a sketch. For example; I wanted a haptic response when a user has selected and is sliding out a credit card in the digital wallet. How can I communicate that in a sketch? Similarly; there were certain screens I wanted to fade in and out. I didn’t know how to convey that through a sketch. 3. When is it necessary to explicitly put something in writing for the consumer and when is it visually more pleasing to leave it up to intuition? For example; I first considered not including the button that indicated “€ -› $”. I thought I would just have the consumer click their amount total in their account and have the screen “flip” to the other currency. However; I wasn’t sure if this would be intuitive for most users; so I included a separate button. After showing the prototype sketch to one of the participants; she commented; “There are too many screens before I get to my wallet. I want to be able to just log in and go.” I wasn’t sure if this was just one consumer’s opinion or if I needed to pare down the instructions at the beginning. All in all I found the process gratifying. When I “finished” the prototyping I wanted to continue developing different ideas. I look forward to tackling more projects!

And what next? Here are some clues. Photo by Makayla Ostapa on Unsplash This past month I read and wrote about the book LikeWar: The Weaponization of Social Media by P.W. Singer & Emerson T. Brooking. I found the book so eye-opening I felt compelled to ask for it for Christmas. The authors address a whole range of subjects related to the new media; but devote special attention to the 2016 election between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. The degree to which social media has been in play in our elections is mind-boggling; and only now seems to have become apparent. Public domain. It’s not like the 2016 election was the first to utilize social media influence. Obama was adept to a certain degree with the emerging possibilities of social media; as this Atlantic article notes. But that was all warm-up compared to election 2016. Very early on Hillary’s army took to the trenches; making moves to gain an advantage. According to Nick Allen’s article in The Telegraph; “Mrs Clinton employed more than 100 people in her digital team and spent tens of millions of dollars targeting millennials with a series of hi-tech messages on Facebook.” That sounds like a fairly hefty commitment; and on the surface appears sensible. Millennials are wedded to their devices; the pundits assume. Her husband Bill; and I am not suggesting husbands are always right; encouraged her to spend money on blue collar workers in the Rust Belt states; which had been hurting since the 2008 recession. Hillary’s digital teams pushed for the social media maneuver. Nick Allen proposes that this was a mistake. In LikeWar; Singer and Brooking go into great detail as regards the Trump campaign’s utilization of these tools. Donald Trump had spent a lifetime playing the media game. He was no newbie in this jungle. And he made his own rules. “With his Twitter loudspeaker; Trump could drive the national conversation at a pace and volume that left both journalists and his opponents scrambling to keep up;” write the authors. “It allowed him not just to dominate the web-borne portion of the 2016 election; but to dominate all other forms of media through it; thus… Create an account to read the full story.

Students can complete the full course in 30 weeks; with a forty-hour time commitment per week; and the Computer Science Academy offers the ability to become a part-time student and complete it in 12 months; with a 3-hour daily commitment for 4 days of the week. The school has also set up Slack; the common team collaboration tool; to make communication easier. By logging onto the platform; students can directly communicate with professors and TAs and that way; help is provided instantaneously during school hours. This complements the live lectures incredibly well and allows students to avoid the response lag that email brings. The key differentiator for Lambda school that sets it apart from the other schools in the realm of online learning? Students pay nothing up-front. Instead; once they secure a job and earn at least $50;000 per year; they pay back 17% of their annual income for the first two years; with total tuition being capped at $30;000. If for some reason; a student is unable to find a job with a salary above the set threshold; they are not required to pay anything. Students can also opt to pay a tuition of $20;000 up-front with no later income-based repayment. Lambda School is clever with this business model. They recognize that with the rise of AI and the increased presence of technology in many aspects; the job market for software engineering and data science is on the rise; fast. Companies are hungry for driven; knowledgeable; and skilled workers who have experience with back-end development; coding; and handling data and these companies are looking to hire good talent. When looking at job outlooks; according to the Bureau of Labour Statistics; Software Developers have an estimated 24% growth from 2016 to 2026; which is a much faster growth rate compared to the average of around an 8% growth rate. The drop-out rate for the school is roughly 10%; which is relatively impressive considering the intense personal commitment demanded by the curriculum. Through an application process; Lambda School allows itself to be selective about the students it accepts into the program; and it has found that the key to a good student is found in their drive. The students who are consistently out-performing their peers are the hard workers who demonstrate this trait from the beginning. A look at their financial payback set-up also proves the company has clearly thought of all its potential pitfalls. 17% of 50;000; the required minimum level of annual income; is $8500 per year. The typical entry-level software engineer salary has a median pay of $64;787 CDN. In more senior positions; the Bureau of Labour Statistics even reported a median pay in 2016 of $102;280. 17% of the median pay for an entry-level position is $10;996.80. It is typically difficult for an entry-level position to pay less than a $50;000 salary; which allows the school to mitigate the risk of a student not being able to pay tuition. To mitigate this tuition-default risk even further; Lambda School has established a strong employer partners network. They have over 75 industry partners who offer the school and its student’s ongoing support; as well as hiring newly-minted developers right when they’re finished the rigorous curriculum. These partners are actively looking to hire Lambda’s students specifically; and as industry partners; they’re able to give the school feedback on the curriculum and work with them on developing and changing it. This set-up means that students have a better chance of securing a reputable job following completion of the program; the companies are hiring quality talent who went through a curriculum that they approved of; and Lambda School is receiving their desired income-based compensation. It’s a win-win-win. Recently; an Apprenticeship Program was also launched. Companies commit to creating a 3 to 6 month long paid internship with the potential for a full-time hire at the end; and the school works on finding the perfect candidate for them. Both the ongoing expansion of the partners’ network and this Apprenticeship Program is a strategic move for Lambda as it plays well into the well-known knowledge of the cost of a bad hire; and the risk and anxiety that often surrounds companies when finding new; quality talent. According to the Society for Human Resource Management; the cost of a bad hire is 5 times the bad hire’s annual salary. These costs not only include the costs of re-hiring and replacing the employee; but also the effect it can have on the organization; its culture; and productivity and performance as a whole. Companies; especially in a field that is as fast-paced and innovative as computing and technology; want the A-listers of the technology realm. They cannot afford to keep around second tiered individuals who drive away the superstars and influence the organizational culture. Lambda strives to deliver these A-team programmers; who were primed with 30 weeks of intense learning and training; right to the company’s front doors. Above all; what truly makes Lambda shine is its mission of “investing in human potential”. Their desire is to aide ambitious individuals in their pursuit of building a new skill set; and they set a good example of what more organizations should be investing in. Lambda’s goal; at its core; is to grant access to higher education for those who may be getting left behind for different social reasons. According to a study done by the National Association of Student Financial Aid and Administrators; low-income students cannot afford 95 percent of colleges in the United States. It is a bit of a play into the division between the ‘haves’ and the ‘have-nots’; but their aspirations to invest in the ‘have-nots’ to help them achieve higher paying jobs is admirable. Beyond solely financial reasons; Lambda is certainly very cognizant of the additional fear that many students carry with them when beginning to walk down a new path. A lot of people in Silicon Valley underestimate how big of a risk it is to go to school for four years; take out potentially crippling student loans; and hope that it all works out on the other side. Especially if an individual doesn’t know if technology engineering is the path for them; it can be a big risk with a huge opportunity cost to go to school; spend so much time building a skill set; and then end up switching careers or programs. As Lambda so accurately phrases it; with their business model; it is school investing in the students; instead of the other way around. And this is truly what the mission of many educational institutions should be. Lambda School is supporting the next generation of up and coming tech enthusiasts by feeding their interests; at a risk-free level; and allowing them to expand their skill set by providing them with not only knowledge but also tangible experience upon completion of the program. It allows these hungry; ambitious; and passionate individuals to fully immerse themselves in the curriculum and walk out with a completely new and advanced toolbox; one with which they can ideally use to create an impact with and revolutionize the technological horizon.

Microsoft + GitHub,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write Microsoft + GitHub Mayank Kishore · Follow Published in Buzzwords · 4 min read · Jan 1; 2019 100 (original post date; 7/30/2018) 7.5 billion dollars. That’s the price at which Microsoft bought GitHub this past month. Why? Sure; GitHub is a platform accessed daily by thousands of coders; but what made it valuable enough for Microsoft to value it at 7.5 billion dollars? Was it to promote the use of Microsoft’s IDE; Visual Studio Code? Nope; as CEO Satya Nadella has assured us that there will be no major changes to GitHub’s infrastructure. Though no clear statement was made on GitHub’s use to Microsoft; it is clear that Microsoft is shifting its company ideologies in a new direction; emphasizing the importance of collaboration and open source. Instead; with GitHub’s 27 million+ software developers working on over 85 million repositories of code; it is quite apparent that Microsoft is focusing on serving software developers (whether those developers are coding for Windows or not). GitHub assures its users that this acquisition would have no impact on the platform they’ve come to love. Current CEO Chris Wanstrath said that “Their focus on developers lines up perfectly with our own; and their scale; tools and global cloud will play a huge role in making GitHub even more valuable for developers everywhere.” With Nat Friedman taking over GitHub as CEO and Wanstrath gearing up to join Microsoft’s board; Wanstrath’s faith in Microsoft is largely based on their ability to maintain a high level of autonomy and on the moves made by Microsoft’s current CEO over the past few years. In fact; let’s talk a little bit about the level-headed and forward-thinking vanguard of Microsoft: Satya Nadella. CEO of Microsoft; Satya Nadella This deal shows the enormous changes that the current CEO has put in place since he took charge. Only a couple of years ago; Microsoft was taking yearly losses as it struggled to compete with the giants of Google and Apple. By ditching the Windows Phone; Microsoft has been able to focus on improving different aspects of its business model. With its emphasis on computing; Microsoft has taken leaps which show in their increased profits and (finally) some significant positive quarterly earnings. Nadella’s move to acquire LinkedIn in 2016 was no rushed decision either. A 26 billion dollar acquisition; Satya Nadella was turning the company around from Steve Ballmer’s costly mistake with Nokia; where Microsoft tried to capture the mobile market by pushing the Windows Phone. Nadella is committed to shaping the image of Microsoft from one of a closed community to one of open inclusion. His accomplishment with shifting Microsoft’s public image cannot be understated and; with his latest move; it seems that Nadella is making all of the right moves; opening his arms to open source software. But how will Nadella integrate Microsoft’s environment with GitHub? GitHub hosts over 27 million developers who depend on using GitHub’s services daily. Since these developers serve as the key market for Microsoft’s developer tools; Microsoft will be able to push its technologies to a larger market. Their goal is to be able to empower developers at “every step of the development lifecycle.” Their biggest plans come with the GitHub marketplace where Microsoft intends to utilize the marketplace in order to push all of Microsoft’s tools and services to make it available to everyone in the developer community. Finally; Microsoft is dedicated to seamlessly integrating Visual Studio Code’s environment directly into GitHub so developers can collaborate with less effort and boost overall productivity. The last bit of interesting news comes from Diane Greene; head of Google’s cloud; who mentioned; “I wouldn’t have minded buying them.” Google has two of GitHub’s largest projects; TensorFlow and Kubernetes; and are GitHub’s biggest contributor. Greene suggested that Microsoft’s bid may have been too high to prompt Google to throw its hat into the ring. She leaves off with the hope the Microsoft will keep GitHub neutral because GitHub was founded on the basis of open source. Finally; Satya Nadella’s explains the merger: “Computing is becoming embedded in the world; with every part of our daily life and work and every aspect of our society and economy being transformed by digital technology. Developers are the builders of this new era; writing the world’s code. And GitHub is their home.” Albeit polished; his words continue to reflect Microsoft’s bright future. The deal will close later this year; with the payment being completed in stocks.

The 2018 Crypto Rollercoaster,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write Member-only story The 2018 Crypto Rollercoaster Alice Bonasio · Follow Published in Tech Trends · 3 min read · Jan 1; 2019 It has been a hectic year on the emerging crypto markets! This infographic looks back on the roller coaster ride W ith any tech; any industry; and any product — there are fluctuations. Whether they’re positive or negative; every market has them. And of course; this can be said for the world of crypto in 2018. It’s been an eventful year in the crypto space. From dramatic price changes; forks and shifting market trends. In 2018; cryptocurrency markets continued to show growth in regions across the globe; showcasing the world’s desire to exercise more control over their finances. Since before the boom of December 2017; the crypto industry broke into the watchful; and sometimes cynical eye of the public. There’s been speculation; regulation changes; social media monitoring; and more in 2018. Here is a summary of some of the biggest crypto landmarks of the past 12 months by Magdalena Gołębiewska; Country Manager at Luno The first three months of 2018 are summarized below followed by the infographic for the whole year. January 2018 The bull market of the holiday season came screaming to a halt as we entered 2018 Bitcoin lost 40% of its value over January. This decline was due in part to new regulations in South Korea; as well as Facebook announcing they were starting to ban the advertising of cryptocurrencies and crypto exchanges. February 2018 By February; nearly half of 2017’s ICOs failed to attract funding. Fortune reported that 142 ICOs failed before reaching their target; while another 276 failed after their fundraising ended. While some of these were actual token sales to raise money for would-be start-ups; a good number of these ICOs turned out to be scams; with the founders disappearing with the money raised. It’s always important to make sure you thoroughly research a company; its employees; and founders before deciding to buy their tokens. March 2018 March brought with it better news for the cryptosphere.

The Mobile Phone and Blockchain.,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write The Mobile Phone and Blockchain. Pritish Sanyal · Follow Published in DataDrivenInvestor · 2 min read · Jan 1; 2019 38 When mobiles appeared on the market; it was a terrible alternative to the then present solution; which was a personal computer. No one could imagine using Word and Excel; let alone AR & VR; on a brick-sized object which didn’t make you even look slick. But features such as GPRS; instant messaging and; most remarkably; intangible aspect “mobility”; revolutionised the industry and now we can’t think of a world without our devices. Such is the case with blockchain; and it’s not a great working alternative to the present solution. It’s hard to understand; difficult to code; difficult to implement and has a low adoption. But the intangible aspect that blockchain brings to the table is “trust” that is not centralised under a single authority. Now we can create money; documents; bills and many more things from anywhere for everywhere. But; it is going to take a few years before blockchain becomes a household concept. How is blockchain going to become a household concept? A 5-year-old doesn’t care about the inner workings of a mobile nor of blockchain. They only want to play angry birds. Similarly; a working professional doesn’t care much about the inner workings of a food and grocery delivery app; they are concerned about food being delivered at their doorstep. Mass adoption comes from distribution that does not disrupt the daily working of a consumer. To build distribution you need various catalysts at different stages. Bitcoin was for the early blockchain adopters; nerds who wanted to explain to 5 yr olds what blockchain is. Now comes the turn of the early and late majority for mass adoption. We need to wait and watch to see what will catalyse mass majority. Sectors and projects that will move the needle in the blockchain space in 2019 will be the financial; insurance and retail industry and projects such as Filecoin; Protocol Labs; Origin; and PROPS have the possibility to become mainstream options to the present alternatives.

Our Kids Got Smartphones — Why I’m Okay With This; Seeing The Potential; Not Just Disasters,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write Our Kids Got Smartphones — Why I’m Okay With This; Seeing The Potential; Not Just Disasters Jon Lightle · Follow 4 min read · Jan 1; 2019 -- We gave our kids their own phones recently. They are 7 and 9. Some parents may say it’s the norm these days; some may say my wife and I are bad parents by encouraging entitilement and so on. I disagree; with this highly; if we look this problem from all angles and help navigate our children through responsible use of mobile technology. After all; how can we say chidlren aren’t old enough; even when adults have bad phone habits themselves. (Myself included.) Working from home and learning from home (that’s what I call homeschool); my kids throughout the day may find me texting mom; checking email; making a post; sharing a story on instagram; researching; and so on. They see me use my phone for so many things; they don’t see how much has changed in a decade since these devices have taken over uni-tasking technology. It’s not their fault; look around anywhere in a modernized environment and observe how many adults have their heads hunched down flipping their thumbs up and down on the over the tiny smooth screen. If I was a kid in this era I’d be absorbed too; pondering what do adults do with these things. Actually; tablets and such are nothing new to my kids. They’ve been exposed to an iPad and old iPod touch that weren’t being used since I’ve been able to get a iPhone 4s. During that time my kids were interested in playing games and now they’ve become curious about how to make videos; taking pictures with legos; and how to make apps. Last year; we sold the iPad; the iPod touch was long gone; and were just left with our phones. The kids were okay with this as they trying to save money for a Minecraft Edition Xbox One. I allowed them to borrow my phone to use so they could watch Minecraft tutorials; videos for schoolwork; crafts and reviews for toys. Not long after they wanted to learn to make their own videos just like these. This was ok for awhile; however there were times I had needed to get a call made; a text out; a text back; an email out; a post made; spend time engaging; and in all honesty I was becoming frustrated. And that’s when my wife and I considered the idea of our kids having the responsibility of a phone. Sure; they could just have an iPad to do this; but this came down to cost for us. Yesteryears iPhones are much cheaper than they were before and my kids didn’t have to have latest and greatest. Just something small enough to take with them; snap pictures; record video and contact us if there was an emergency. In a sense; having their own phone was no different from having an iPad; just now they would use cellular data. What’s more is with recent updates on time limits for screen time and more security for kids I was really warming up to the possibility. I also knew at some point they would have to learn about saftey online and I couldn’t shield them from everything. There was one surprising idea that really opened the door for me on this issue. The internet of today has shifted social media and mobile engagement. For some time now businesses are utilizing Facebook; Instagram and Twitter. It’s not just big businesses; it’s little shops in towns; the auto repair shop and the bakery just blocks away. They’re using the live features; posting news; specials and engaging with customers on social media. As an example; a small local baby shop selling cloth diapers; natural baby soaps and toys is posting to stories and live video showcasing products and answering questions from customers viewing the feed. My point to this; is that my kids are seeing this; they’re seeing me do it too; as a freelance illustrator I have to engage in this social world as this is where the world is today. I don’t know what the future entirely holds for jobs and so on but I’d have to say this is a great time for them to learn where things are today. My kids are interested in making videos; they want to share their ideas; wild as they maybe to the world. They don’t know what they want to be when they grow up yet; but they’re willing to figure it out along the way. I know there is some backlash on letting kids have phones and using social media but what if it helped them solve problems going on in the world; what if it helped them take their ideas and make impact on someones life. Whether you agree or not; I feel like our children deserve to know the truth of where the worlds attention is; learn about issues going; and being an active part of this period of time. Yes I agree; there are lots of bad things in the digital world; but there is also lots of bad things in the real world.

Curation as Art,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write Curation as Art Connor Miller · Follow 4 min read · Jan 2; 2019 4 The purpose of a librarian is to help the reader navigate overwhelm. The library is a huge place; that collects information that is organized by a set of rules. The librarian; familiar with the rules; listens to the reader and guides them to the appropriate section; author; or title. On the internet; we are faced with one of the largest libraries in the world. Similar to the moving staircases in Harry Potter; the rules change; the platforms change; and it can be difficult to find real news; useful information; or good content. Because the internet is vast and hard to navigate; I find we need guides; similar to librarians; who can take us to the places that contain the information that we need. The first librarian is our search engine (most likely Google). However Google is influenced by paid advertisements; and our results can be determined by what people want to sell us rather than what we actually want to read. This is why I have come back to a more humanistic approach to getting recommendations; since people tend to curate every day and can guide us (like librarians) to the real and true information. The second librarian; then; is our community. Every day I am on Facebook; Twitter; and Instagram; scrolling through a sea of content; liking; following; and unfollowing as I see fit. This is a form of curation that allows me to tailor my feed to my tastes. You do this; your friends to this; and anyone online does a version of this; making us all curators. We weed out what we don’t want to see and maximize what we do want. The result is a unique assortment of content that falls in line with what we want. Each person has specific taste; which makes each collection of online content singular and special. For example; I have a friend named Oscar who subscribes to an assortment of meme pages on Facebook; which he then shares through his own Facebook page. He shares the ones that he likes; and thus establishes a tone through his shared content. I enjoy the memes that Oscar shares; and even though he is not producing original content; the stream itself feels like original content. It is a little like making a music mashup. The final result is a piece of art build from the art of others. It reminds me of collages; or a scrapbook collection. Oscar’s product is his taste; which I support and subscribe to. In an effort to understand other people’s tastes and tendencies towards curation; I started a project called “CultureBucket”; in which I ask my friends every year to make a “Best of” list of media they consumed. This way I get a sense of what my friends are interested and the themes they follow in their own curation. I post these lists on a blog which you can read here. There are other folks as well who have really leaned in to the curation game. My favorite is Maria Popova; creator of Brainpickings (link). Self-described as a “curator of interestingness”; Popova reads a massive amount of books weekly; and shares excerpts of her favorites online. Many of the books she picks can be found at your local library. She will sometimes review bestsellers; but she also manages to bring in older books and authors that have insight that is still relevant today. On the topics of love; creativity; and living well; I find myself constantly coming back to Brainpickings for Popova’s exceptional taste. So; by taking note of how both Oscar and Popova manage to drive interest simply through sharing their collections; I think that we all can become conscious curators. Futhermore; I think knowing that curation is an art can help us find good accounts to follow as well. I find Joi Ito to be my favorite online curator. He has a podcast series in which he interviews his friends and colleagues in a informal manner; discussing extremely relevant and technical problems that we face today. Most recently I find myself re-listening to his conversation with Virginia Heffernan (link) in which they talk about how language and the internet influence each other. These conversations often serve as leads for other topics I am interested in. I am currently reading two books; each written by different folks Joi Ito has interviewed. I believe it is a meaningful pursuit to be a conscious curator of your own feed; and to pursue others who also are aware of the content that they are consuming and sharing. In the modern sea of media; we all become guides of our own areas of interest and expertise. We are all librarians of specific sections; and we become that much more powerful by helping others work their way through the stacks.

My anti-moon comment was deleted,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write My anti-moon comment was deleted Rhiannon Payne · Follow Published in Sea Foam Media & Tech · 4 min read · Dec 14; 2018 695 12 BTC headed for the moon? Last week I replied to what was a rather ridiculous LinkedIn post about the Bitcoin market; with a well-reasoned response against the alleged “moon” coming — which was immediately deleted by the poster. I’m a huge proponent of the potential of blockchain technology (obviously). I’m also intrigued by blockchain’s ability to revolutionize fundraising through STOs; even for projects that don’t utilize blockchain or token economies. However; I am not a traditional crypto investor. I pulled my ETH out in June at a break-even point and I sleep better at night because of it. It seems like the only people still predicting another sky-rocket in the value of BTC are those deeply invested in the market and currently underwater. But to me; the “moon” makes zero sense; for a variety of reasons. And posts like the one I saw last week; whose author deleted my comment; seem deeply misguided and even irresponsible. We should all know that there are no such things as get-rich-quick schemes. I believe that the extreme growth of BTC last year was a flash in the pan; and that people’s “lambo” attitudes today are detrimental to the community as a whole. Let’s consider the original purpose and ethos surrounding Bitcoin — a decentralized currency to give control back to the people; with no influence from major institutions; to eventually replace the USD. For this to happen; it doesn’t matter if BTC sits at $1M or $1. It just has to be STABLE. For it to work; there can’t be the risk of it dropping by 5%; 10%; 20%+ in a week. No one’s going to hang on to it to use in practical situations. The only people with BTC will be those who want to pump and dump it or HODL (lol). If people aren’t using BTC practically then what; exactly; is the point? As the market deteriorates; one thing I keep hearing is “The institutional investors are finally coming! Now that we’ve bottomed; it’s time to moon!!” This is apparently something people have heard from “financial analysts” and “asset managers.” But here we are; at the crux of the problem — BTC has become yet another currency that’s influenced by the rich; more-so than USD. If a “whale” invests a quarter-billion in BTC and the price “moons;” how is that giving control back to the people? At this point; all arguments I’m seeing for the growth in value of BTC literally hinge on market manipulation. And yes; regulations are coming — but that’s not necessarily going to impact BTC; which the SEC has already determined to be “sufficiently decentralized.” And when people say that more institutional investors are ready to come in at long last; that’s the exact opposite of what I have heard from such investors; who are now eyeing stable; regulated STOs as the real opportunity. The idea of tokenizing a security like equity; with real-world drivers behind the tokens like a company’s growth; is amazing. Real estate is another great use case for security tokens; making high-end real estate investments accessible to a larger pool of investors. I’ve also spoken to credible securities lawyers who see a possible future where all stocks and bonds trade on blockchain. This is fascinating and exciting stuff. I’m not saying now is or isn’t a good time for investors to buy. Heck; I don’t know; it probably is. (*I am not a financial advisor) So if you want to pump and dump and HODL; your call — but that’s not helping BTC and the crypto community; just creating an environment that’s increasingly unsustainable. And if this offends you so much that you want to delete my comment; I think that only adds to the validity of what I’m saying. Sorry to burst your bubble. That said; let’s keep innovating; finding real use cases; and exploring ways to make cryptocurrencies more accessible to the public; even if it’s not BTC. I truly believe that blockchain and a universal cryptocurrency has the ability to unite us and create a more equitable world. It’s already having a profound impact on emerging and unstable economies. I also see it bringing niche communities of people together. This is the stuff that excites me! Not day trading to make a quick buck. If you have a different opinion; please share. I’m not a trading expert; just a blockchain agency owner and enthusiast. I am very open to hearing different perspectives and ideas. Edit: I’ve had this post sitting here in my drafts; waiting to be published; for a few weeks now. Are we closer to the moon yet? I guess the new year will tell.

How to Create a React app from scratch using Webpack 4,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write How to Create a React app from scratch using Webpack 4 linhothy · Follow Published in We’ve moved to freeCodeCamp.org/news · 8 min read · Mar 12; 2018 -- 91 For the past three weeks; I have been trying to create a React app from scratch to understand the set-up with Webpack. My aim was to set up a simple configuration which can then be grown upon. It’s been a struggle to understand Webpack. But thanks to this tutorial by Valentino Gagliardi; I’m much enlightened. What I’m planning to do is to make a search functionality with some fake JSON data (or real). In this blog post; I will go through the set up of my project. In the next one; I am planning to show how to set up testing. I would also like to add a server to this using Node.js; but not sure if the scope of my project would need that. (Note: I have provided my Webpack setup at the end of this blog post) Without further ado; let’s get on with the set up! Make a new project and cd into it: mkdir react_search cd react_search Create a package.json file: npm init If you want to skip all the questions; add the -y flag: npm init -y We need to install webpack as a dev dependency and webpack-cli so that you can use webpack in the command line: npm i webpack webpack-cli -D i: install -D: — save-dev Create a src folder with index.js and place the following code as an example: console.log("hello"); Now add the following scripts to your package.json (in bold): {   "name": "react_search";   "version": "1.0.0";   "description": "Search app using React";   "main": "index.js";   "scripts": {     "start": "webpack --mode development";     "build": "webpack --mode production"   };   "keywords": [];   "author": "";   "license": "ISC";   "devDependencies": {     "webpack": "^4.0.1";     "webpack-cli": "^2.0.10"   } } Webpack 4 now has two modes; development and production where code is minimised in the latter. See it for yourself by running: npm run start This will create a dist folder with main.js file inside (containing your src code). If you now run: npm run build The following output is now like this: Setting Up React and Babel To work with React; we need to install it along with Babel. This will transpile the code from ES6 to ES5; as not all browsers support ES6 yet (for example Internet Explorer). Install react and react-dom as a dependency npm i react react-dom -S -S: — save Then install babel-core; babel-loader; babel-preset-env and babel-preset-react as a dev dependency: npm i babel-core babel-loader babel-preset-env babel-preset-react -D babel-core: Transforms your ES6 code into ES5 babel-loader: Webpack helper to transform your JavaScript dependencies (for example; when you import your components into other components) with Babel babel-preset-env: Determines which transformations/plugins to use and polyfills (provide modern functionality on older browsers that do not natively support it) based on the browser matrix you want to support babel-preset-react: Babel preset for all React plugins; for example turning JSX into functions We need to create a webpack.config.js file to state the rules for our babel-loader. We then need to make a separate file called .babelrc to provide the options for babel-loader. You can include it in the webpack.config.js file; but I have seen that most projects have this separated. This results in clearer readability; and it can be used by other tools unrelated to webpack. When you state that you’re using babel-loader in your webpack config; it will look for .babelrc file if there is one. Next; change your index.js file to render a component: We will also need to create an index.html file in the src folder where we can add our section element with id index. This is where we render our main react component: Now we need to install html-webpack-plugin and use this in our webpack config file. This plugin generates an HTML file with <script> injected; writes this to dist/index.html; and minifies the file. Install html-webpack-plugin as a dev dependency: npm i html-webpack-plugin -D Update the webpack config like so: You can also input the plugin like this: plugins: [     new HtmlWebPackPlugin({     template: "./src/index.html";     filename: "./index.html"   }); ] But I prefer to extract this into a variable so I can see the list of plugins I am using. The value I am giving the template key is where I am looking for my HTML file. The filename value is the name of the minified HTML that will be generated in the dist folder. If you now run npm run start you should see index.html being generated in the dist folder. Run open dist/index.html and you should see “Hello React” in your browser. Setting up webpack-dev-server It is a bit tedious to keep running this command every time you want to see your changes in the browser. To have webpack “watch” our changes and thus refresh whenever we have made changes to any of our components; we can use webpack-dev-server module. Go ahead and install this as a dev dependency npm i webpack-dev-server -D Then change your package.json start scripts like so (in bold): {   "name": "react_search";   "version": "1.0.0";   "description": "Search app using React";   "main": "index.js";   "scripts": {     "start": "webpack-dev-server --mode development --open";     "build": "webpack --mode production"   };   "keywords": [];   "author": "";   "license": "ISC";   "dependencies": {     "react": "^16.2.0";     "react-dom": "^16.2.0"   "devDependencies": {     "babel-core": "^6.26.0";     "babel-loader": "^7.1.4";     "babel-preset-env": "^1.6.1";     "babel-preset-react": "^6.24.1";     "html-webpack-plugin": "^3.0.6";     "webpack": "^4.1.1";     "webpack-cli": "^2.0.10";     "webpack-dev-server": "^3.1.0"   } } If you now run npm run start you should see localhost:8080 open up in your default browser — that’s what the —-open flag is for. Now everytime you make changes; it will refresh the page. You can also add a --hot flag to your npm start script which will allow you to only reload the component that you’ve changed instead of doing a full page reload. This is Hot Module Replacement. Setting up CSS The last part involves setting up our CSS. As we will be importing CSS files into our React components; we need css-loader module to resolve them. Once that’s resolved; we also need a style-loader to inject this into our DOM — adding a <style> tag into the <head> element of our HTML. Go ahead and install both of these modules as a dev dependency: npm i css-loader style-loader -D We then need to update our webpack.config.js file like so: Note that the order of adding these loaders is important. First; we need to resolve the CSS files before adding them to the DOM with the style-loader. By default; webpack uses the loaders from the right (last element in the array) to the left (first element in the array). Making CSS modular We can also make CSS modular using webpack. This means class name will be scoped locally and specific to only the component in question. To do this; we can provide some options to css-loader: As we need to give options; each loader is now an object with a key-value pair. To enable CSS modules; we need to set module option for css-loader to be true. The importLoaders option configures how many loaders before css-loader should be applied. For example; sass-loader would have to come before css-loader. The localIdentName allows you to configure the generated identification. [name] will take the name of your component [local] is the name of your class/id [hash:base64] is the randomly generated hash which will be unique in every component’s CSS To make this a bit more visual; I’ll give you an example. Say I have a component named Form and I have a button with a CSS class primaryButton. I also have another component called Search and a button in it with a CSS class primaryButton. However; both of these classes have different CSS: Form button .primaryButton {   background-color: green; } Search button .primaryButton {   background-color: blue; } When webpack bundles your application; depending on which CSS comes latest; both of your buttons could have the color green or blue instead of Form having green and Search having blue. This is where the localIdentName comes into place. With this; once your application is bundled; your buttons will have a unique class name! As you can see; the button class name in the Form component is different to the one in the Search component — their naming starts with the name of the component; class name; and unique hash code. So with this; you won’t have to worry about whether you have given the same class name throughout your whole application — you only have to worry about whether you have used it in the same component. This concludes the first part of setting a React app from scratch. In the next blog post; I aim to explain how to set up tests for TDD and how to write them. Please let me know if something is unclear and I’ll explain the best as I can. I value and welcome constructive feedback as this helps me to improve :) Hope this helps! EDIT Importing CSS I’ve had a few comments asking me how they can render CSS which I didn’t touch on previously. What you need to do is import the CSS file in your React component. For example; say you have a Search component and this is your tree directory: You will need to import your CSS file in your Search component like so: import style from "./Search.css" You can then apply different CSS class styles such as: const Search = () => {   return <div className={style.nameOfYourCSSClass}>            Hello Search Component :)          </div> } You don’t have to call it style but what I found is that most people have given it this name in their projects. My Webpack boilerplate For anyone who wants a quick clone of this Webpack setup; I have this on my GitHub. I’ve also included a more succinct guide in the README. Entry and output points Webpack 4 by default has a default entry point of index.js in your src folder. If you would like to point to a different file; you can do so by specifying an entry point in your webpack config file: e.g. module.exports = {   entry: "./src/app.js";   module: {    ...   } } You can also specify output file like so: const path = require('path') module.exports = {   entry: "./src/app.js";   output: {     path: path.resolve(‘dist’);     filename: ‘bundled.js’   };   module: {     ...   } } Thanks to Gudu Kassa for pointing this out!

New Year new security protocol?,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write New Year new security protocol? zCode Solutions · Follow 2 min read · Jan 1; 2019 With the coming of a new year comes new goals; new dreams — and most importantly; new technology. When technology has existed for a while we forget how sometimes there is a security risk involved in using it. This can be said about the file directory navigation system. Since the first computer system came out the hierarchical file structure could be navigated through the command line system. After operating systems improved and GUI (graphical user interfaces) systems evolved the computer’s internal file structure could be traversed through a GUI interface. Of course; with every new advancement comes new exploitation. Cyber criminals that gain access to your hardware can download sensitive documents with 2 to 3 clicks of a mouse. As a precautionary measure you could put a password on your work folder and make it more difficult to obtain your documents — but once that password is cracked; then it’s all for naught. To resolve this problem IBM has crafted an innovative piece of technology called the Decoy File system (DcyFS). Like layering a cake; the DcyFS overlays a custom view that can do each of the following: Remove sensitive data (1) Dynamically replace files with fakes (1) Inject new Decoy files (1) The DcyFS system provides write control on documents you designate as “sensitive.” With documents given the “sensitive” tag; the DcyFS system replaces those files with fakes. In addition it can also create a honeypot trap by adding fake documents to entice cyber criminals looking to steal information. Once the “honey pot” is accessed it will leave a forensic trail for specialists to analyze and identify the users main objective.

Time is an abstraction,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write Member-only story Time is an abstraction ScottCDunn · Follow 4 min read · Jan 1; 2019 Another year has come and gone. During the last year; we celebrated anniversaries; holidays; and birthdays. We do this to mark the time; and give ourselves a sense of perspective. We mark the seasons; the height of our children as they grow older; and rites of passage. We want to know where we have been and where we are going. The year is 2019. That is supposed to mark 2;019 years since the life of Christ; a man whom no one alive today can know for sure existed. Yet we use the birth and death of that person as a reference for keeping time. According to the Hebrew Calendar; the year is 5779; and they used a different starting time to arrive at that number of years. There are many different calendars; and even Western Civilization changed calendars in the relatively modern time of 1923. From Wikipedia: 1752 (MDCCLII) was a leap year starting on Saturday of the Gregorian calendar and a leap year starting on Wednesday of the Julian calendar; the 1752nd year of the Common Era (CE) and Anno Domini (AD) designations; the 752nd year of the 2nd millennium; the 52nd year of the 18th century; and the 3rd year of the 1750s decade. As of the start of 1752; the Gregorian calendar was 11 days ahead of the Julian calendar; which remained in localized use until 1923. In the British Empire; it was the only year with 355 days; as 3–13 September were skipped when the Empire adopted the Gregorian calendar. In just that passage alone; we can see how many adjustments were made to keep the calendar in sync with the sun and the seasons. A year is actually 365.2422 days; depending on the measure you use. To make up for that difference we insert leap years into our calendars to keep our calendars in sync with the seasons. Delving a little deeper; we also learn that a “day” is not exactly 24 hours (from Wikipedia): Stellar day[edit] A day; understood as the span of time it takes for the Earth to make one entire rotation[11] with respect to the celestial background or a distant star (assumed to be fixed); is called a stellar day. This period of rotation is about 4 minutes less than 24 hours (23 hours 56 minutes and 4.1 seconds) and there are about 366.2422 stellar days in one mean tropical year (one stellar day more than the number of solar days).

You Are Fake News,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write You Are Fake News Joss Biddle · Follow Published in Clippings Autumn 2018 · 4 min read · Jan 2; 2019 2 When you see the words ‘fake news’; you probably start to think of click-bait popping up on your social media feed; or some story in the papers the other day which got discredited the day after; or President Trump’s face swims before your eyes. You can practically hear him saying it. ‘Fake news’. by Gregroose; Pixabay.com I’m here to tell you; that you; are (probably) fake news. If you have a social media account; the chances are you are at least vaguely aware of your online image; you know what you have uploaded to your profile(s) and you don’t put any old toot up there. Why? It’s because; whether you admit it or not; you want to look good in the eyes of others. From the profile picture you set; to the daily; weekly or monthly posts you make (depending on how much of a lurker you are) you are making decisions about how you want people to perceive you; a physical image and a personality image. A cherry-picked impression of the real life you. You; but through rose coloured spectacles. #nofilter. By Geralt at Pixabay.com I’m not going to tell you this is a terrible thing that you shouldn’t do. After all; you should be careful what you put online these days; especially with nosy potential employers turning to social media to get a behind-the-curtain look at prospectus employees and their habits. However; when you start to see other people’s online profiles; it can be easy to forget that they do the exact same thing. In fact; according to the 2018 ‘Vacation Confidence Index’¹ 36% of people aged 18–34 admitted they deceive their social media followers with their posts; making their holidays seem greater than they were. The main reasons for doing this were to either make their followers envious; or to try and one up the other accounts they followed on social media. This can end up giving the rather depressing impression that your life only has great bits in a sea of mediocrity; but everybody else is always having an absolutely great time. All the time. It unsurprising then; that social media users tend to have be more depressed¹. It’s important to maintain perspective when using social media; as the saying goes; ‘the grass is always greener on the other side’. Well now the other side is covered in flowers; puppies are everywhere and the old worn-down shed is covered by Potter’s cloak of invisibility. It’s hard not to be dissatisfied with your own patchy grass when faced with that. Image by Robin Worrall; Unsplash.com Interestingly; despite admitting to being deceptive in their own posts online; the 2018 ‘Vacation Confidence Index’ showed that people trust posts from others they know personally on social media the most; followed by trusted brands; then media organisations and lastly posts from social media users they don’t know personally.¹ This tells us we still rely on knowing a ‘source’ personally to trust them rather than the general reputation of said source. When you only trust and add people; that you know personally off social media; on social media; the networking features of social media seem pointless. Perhaps then; social media idea is just a big fat fakery platform; and the only way to view it is cynically. A platform for image selling. So take it with a pinch of salt; embrace the false nature of it; and use it with that in mind. Image by Kev Costello; Unsplash.com Through this lense though; its hard to see the point of social media networking. Want to share a photo? Share it to a group ‘WhatsApp’ chat. Want to keep in contact with someone? Exchange numbers. It seems to me the only niche function of social media is that it allows you to maintain a vague connection with acquaintances and snoop on people you used to know. Image by Michael Jasmund; Unsplash.com With the function and effects of social media coming into question; many are asking themselves whether they’re wasting their time on these networking sites. For the first time Emarketer predicted the decline of users of Facebook aged 18 to 24². With Facebook; the most widely used social media platform³; losing the interest of younger generations; social media may be showing some signs of losing relevancy. Moving on into the new year; it may be time for you to assess your use of online networking and decide if you really want to invest any more time in the endless news feeds of social media.

Highlights; Insights and Soundbites from the “Our People-Centered Digital Future” Event,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write Highlights; Insights and Soundbites from the “Our People-Centered Digital Future” Event PCI Initiative · Follow Published in People-Centered Internet · 11 min read · Jan 1; 2019 -- Held December 10; 2018 at the Fairmont Hotel; San Jose. The Occasion Marked the near 50% Tipping Point for Global Internet Access and 70 Years Since the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. www.peoplecentered.net Archive of the Livestream available online with subtitles. Visual Journal by Eileen Clegg and Yolanda Youngblood; Visual Insight Mural by Eileen and Yolanda A historic event scaling the vision for the People-Centered Internet coalition was held on December 10; 2018 by Ray Wang; Founder of Constellation Research; who worked closely with Dr. David Bray; Executive Director for PCI. It was a moment in time coinciding with these milestones: 50 percent of people in the world now officially connected to the Internet The United Nations marks the 70thanniversary of the Declaration of Human Rights 50 years since Dr. Douglas Engelbart created the “Mother of all Demos” showing the first computer mouse; hyperlinking; videoconferencing and other inventions that foreshadowed the era of personal computing. Among the speakers were People Centered Internet (PCI) founders Dr. Vinton G. Cerf and Mei Lin Fung; Dr. David Bray and Marci Harris; Executive Director and Board Treasurer for PCI respectively; Constellation Research CEO Ray Wang; World Wide Web creator Sir Tim Berners-Lee; semantic web visionary Dame Wendy Hall; iconic technology designer Joy Mountford; former President of Estonia Toomas Ilves and Ieva Ilves; authors Doc Searls and Joy Searls; along with other luminaries. The event was a marathon series of panel discussions on topics ranging from the future of the Internet and the ethical challenges of Artificial Intelligence to Data Ownership and Human Rights. Here; we’ll share some highlights; insights and soundbites that emerged from the day; captured in murals created live by Visual Insight’s Eileen Clegg and Yolanda Youngblood. We will also share some of the photos taken by PCI volunteer Bill Daul. PCI’s Mei Lin moderating Vint and Ray on stage Background Vint Cerf — inventor of the TCP/IP protocols enabling the Internet along with Bob Kahn in 1973 — has devoted the past four decades to finding ways that the Internet can serve humanity by linking people around the globe in a supportive network. In 2014; he joined forces with Mei Lin Fung — who worked closely with Dr. Engelbart on networked improvement communities — to create the nonprofit People-Centered Internet organization (PCI). CEO Ray Wang; Founder of Constellation Research; worked with Dr. David Bray; Executive Director for the People-Centered Internet coalition; to organize a Team of Constellation personnel and volunteers to produce the December 10 conference and gala to garner international support for PCI’s vision for an Internet that measurably improves people’s lives and livelihoods around the globe. Special thanks extended to everyone at Constellation Research (notably Meghan O’Neill Ruona; Aubrey Coggins; and Dennis Kanemitsu) as well as to Marci Harris; Stephanie Wander; Corina DuBois; Tricia Wang; Inna Bagoli; and Felix Velarde. Also thank you to the Internet Society; Joly MacFie; and Cory Strandberg for helping with the videos and interactions. PCI’s David Bray moderating Tricia Wang and panelists on stage Welcome “We’ve got this 50–50 moment;” declared Tim Berners-Lee; referring to the milestone declared by the ITU; the United Nations agency for information and communications technology — that 3.9 billion; half the people on the planet; are now connected to the Internet. “The Web can be there for humanity…It’s all about the individual;” said Berners-Lee; who created the Web Foundation in order to “make sure we get the Web we want.” Mei Lin Fung talked about unleashing the power of technology for good; making the Internet beneficial in ways specific to individual and community needs. Vint Cerf honored the memory of Doug Engelbart with the reminder that the famous December 9; 1968 Demo was inspired by a desire to improve people’s lives. Cerf called on people to focus on the hope and the vision for the Internet; instead of their fears. Mural International Perspectives and Future of the Internet by Early Pioneers Dame Wendy Hall called on the assemblage to focus on another 50–50 statistic. “Women are 50 percent of the Internet;” she said; emphasizing the need to include more women in decisions about the Internet — and the world — moving forward. She expressed hope and concern about a future with “social networks on steroids.” She expressed worry about children in an era where the Internet is being attacked and manipulated but hope for levelling the opportunity landscape. “We are bringing the world to the table;” she said. She cautioned against relying too heavily on software to make decisions that should be made by humans. Cerf; Berners-Lee; and Hall as a panel discussed what the future might hold. The group cautioned about upcoming complexity with the Internet of Things (“what if your fridge digitally attacks someone?”) and the need for people to control their own data. Mural Governing the Internet / 70 Years of Human Rights The former president of Estonia; Toomas Hendrick Ilves; declared the biggest problem on the Internet today: digital interference in elections. He talked about a positive earlier governance event that was initiated by people rather than governments — the “Arab Spring” uprising of people against oppressive governments in 2011. Then political manipulation by Russia followed. He suggested looking to the EU’s approach to Internet governance emphasizing freedom and responsibility rather China’s repression or Silicon Valley’s laissez free-for-all. Perspective from history came from Scott Campbell; Senior Human Rights Officer for the U.N.’s Office of the High Commissioner for Hunan Rights; who said that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights can be invoked today to help us deal with problems eerily similar to those that shook the world when the document was written in 1948: disinformation; hate speech; destruction and the Holocaust. How can we insure “never again”? Commitment to the fundamental conviction that “all people are born free and equal.” Mural Tim and Vint on stage Wendy on stage Toomas on stage Building Human Rights / The Internet & Human Rights Distributed ledgers emerged as a proposed solution to guaranteeing what’s being called the 31sthuman right: The right to our own data. Richie Etwaru called on people to become “courage agents” supporting network agreements the enable people to own their data. Then; members of the panel on the Internet & Human Rights raised a call for faster action if the Internet is to hold to the original hope as a place of connection; imagination and self-expression. Will technology interfere with those human rights or enhance them? “The decisions we make today will be with us for a long time.” Remedying Disinformation / Free from Fear / Internet Growing Pains Multiple panelists concluded that it’s up to all of us to grow “a digital world where truth can survive.” Among the branches are: New approaches — with good intentions; humility and government working together with industry Safety — with user education; ways to rate the accuracy of information; and inclusion of children’s needs; Attention to unfinished work — ethics; awareness that all information tends to persist Identity — focus on privacy Education — listening and making commitments/agreements to care about the next generation’s safety and well-being. PCI’s David Bray moderated a panel of Ilves; Doreen Bogdan-Martin of the ITU; and Alex Gladstein from the Human Rights Foundation on the challenges that the Internet presents to societies and pluralistic co-existence; to include the need for guidelines for corporations. Smarter Cities & Digital Heartlands / Digital Inclusion This is the era of cities with 70 per cent of people living in urban areas; while rural areas are less connected and more vulnerable. Populations including Native Americans and countries including Africa are not being served by the Internet. Right now; it’s important to look for “cultural hotspots” where people aren’t connected. This is where People Centered Internet can have real impact. We need to get the policies right — government must get involved — and stay focused on serving people regardless of their financial resources. It’s a problem that “when money gets involved; different people are served.” “Think of the Internet as a basic utility.” That way; finances are not the determinant of who has access. Panelists on stage More discussions on stage Ray Wang leading a Fireside Chat on stage World of A.I. / Shared Prosperity Artificial Intelligence will bring a wave of challenges and opportunity. The emerging technologies should be considered ways to augment — not replace — human capacity. They can enhance the mundane with innovation; creativity and personalization. But we must balance the risk with how A.I. can meet our needs. Inclusive growth requires real time data + better decisions + a clearer picture + peer-to-peer analysis. Both PCI’s David Bray and Salesforce’s John Taschek emphasized a vision for technology-enhancing prosperity that requires we lead with empathy and scale our personal morals into social ethics. Most problems are a failure in communication. The Internet and Whole Human Health / Open and Personal Data Sets The People-Centered Internet starts with the individual; and the most basic need for the individual is health. Individual health can be enhanced by data in context. “We are all digital beings now” and each of us could be a “data donor.” Via sensors; we can; if we want to; contribute information that enables research to deliver better healthcare. Our health data — and all our data — can better serve us if we have a personal dashboard enabling us to access it. But we need to be cautious at a time when “the Internet knows more about me than I know about myself.” Education / Community Resilience / Safeguarding Digital Infrastructure “Technology was thrust on education.” While can continue to try experiments to make it work within the current educational structure in the U.S.; there are barriers. “The only firewall bigger than China’s is public education.” Imagine a world where public education embraced the capacity of the Internet. “What if we could be more portable with our learning?” For students the potential is endless: “Technology connects us with the world.” On the topic of Community Resilience; we heard a call to work from the ground up — using technology to create a local alert and multi-alert network. High definition cameras can help us anticipate disasters — seeing fires before they rage out of control. Instead of bouncing back — we can bounce forward. Accessibility for All / Mural Nets / Trust Mariel Triggs described how accessibility is occurring on tribal lands with new libraries and access to education. The engine that will run these networks is trust. “The DNA for the future needs to have trust at the core.” Safeguarding digital infrastructure matters as we increasingly become dependent on the Internet. Already we have proven models at the community level; but for partnerships to scale; we need government to focus on fostering — not simply regulating — partnerships. “Developing trust is good business.” Elements of trust are transparency and a long view of the future. Panelists on stage More discussions on stage Discussing resiliency Discussing artificial intelligence Discussing corporate responsibility Discussing social impact A.I. and Human Lives; the Internet and Corporate Responsibility Artificial intelligence transforms our lives; yet panelists raised caution about aspects of human intelligence that might not be replicated; the potential for bias baked into the box; and the need for ethics. Joy Mountford raised a laugh from the crowd; then said; “hopefully you’ll see the humor in things the computer cannot.” How can we motivate corporate responsibility? One idea was to have a seal for best practices. Moderators continually invoked another method — peer pressure; calling out companies who have had failures in responsibility; and praising those that demonstrated responsibility The Future of Work and Social Impact Looking at the future of work in the context of the Internet; panelists noted the biggest problem is that people do not feel safe online. If we are to achieve a truly people-centric Internet; the locus of control must move from corporations to individuals; individuals need protection. If these problems can be addressed and good decisions are made today; technology will augment rather than eliminate jobs. We are likely to have a new definition of work and new social contract that benefits workers. The social impact of the Internet balances risk and freedom — a balance that can be hard to understand because there are so many variables we cannot predict. PCI’s Marci Harris moderating a panel PCI’s David Bray leading a Fireside Chat Vint Cerf and Ray Wang provide closing remarks The day closed with a reflection from Vint Cerf on the future ahead and a motivation for everyone to visit www.peoplecentered.net and sign-up both for the newsletter and to indicate what they can do as positive change agents in the world.

Estas Son Las Grandes Previsiones en Ciberseguridad Para 2019,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write Estas Son Las Grandes Previsiones en Ciberseguridad Para 2019 Balam Seguridad Privada · Follow 2 min read · Jan 1; 2019 -- Una de las costumbres más asentadas en los medios de comunicación cuando se acerca el fin de año es la de publicar las grandes previsiones para el año que está a punto de empezar. La ciberseguridad volverá a ser uno de los principales focos de atención tanto para las empresas como para los usuarios particulares; habida cuenta de las crecientes amenazan que pululan por la red. El informe de PandaLabs para 2019 se atreve a aventurar cuáles serán las tendencias en ciberseguridad más importantes. Piratería “en vivo” Al igual que el streaming ha cambiado la forma en la que escuchamos música; sin necesidad ya de adquirir discos o de descargar previamente las pistas; la piratería también podría optar por un formato “en vivo”. Esta es una tendencia delictiva particularmente grave porque nunca se sabe cuándo y dónde se va a producir el siguiente ataque. No hay un malware a la espera de ser descargado imprudentemente sino que un hacker ataca directamente una red. Soberanía digital europea Quédate con este concepto porque es posible que no tardes mucho en escucharlo por boca de alguna de las principales autoridades de la Unión Europea. Esta organización supranacional está dotándose de mayores recursos para hacer frente al desafío de la ciberseguridad y la soberanía digital puede ser una realidad legislativa a medio plazo. Proteger el espacio digital de la UE es una prioridad desde que se constatara la injerencia de potencias extranjeras en procesos electorales de algunos países miembros. Las amenazas ya existentes… y que irán a más Junto a los dos novedades anteriores; algunas de las amenazas que ya afectaron a la ciberseguridad mundial en 2018 seguirán estando presentes -y con mayor intensidad- en 2019. Cryptojacking El uso indebido de computadoras para hacer trabajos de minería de criptomonedas parece un riesgo menor pero lo cierto es que se traduce en un consumo de datos muy oneroso; al tiempo que colaboramos indirectamente con un comportamiento delictivo. Robo de datos personales Las violaciones de datos personales han sido el ciberataque estrella de 2018; con una cifra récord de afectados. Cambridge Analytica; Facebook o Ticketmaster han sido algunas de las grandes víctimas del robo de información personal (y; con ellas; sus miles de millones de usuarios o clientes).

The Dos And Don’ts Of Buying The Fusion3 F410 3d Printer (Review),Open in app Sign up Sign in Write The Dos And Don’ts Of Buying The Fusion3 F410 3d Printer (Review) Buytiny · Follow 6 min read · Jan 2; 2019 -- The Fusion3 F410 3D Printer has been intended to furnish clients with execution and sturdiness equaling modern printers at a small amount of the expense. Fusion3 F410 is an excellent pick for a small machine that packs the punch of a much larger and more expensive 3D printer. At $4;599; the F410 it’s a great deal that goes beyond the usual entry-level fare to quickly create amazing designs. Benefits of Fusion3 410 3d Printer High quality parts at blazingly quick speeds (up to 250MM/sec) — All metal 3D print head with solidified steel spout. The Fusion3 410 is worth every penny. This product is encased in a print zone with multi-zone warmed bed; giving stable temperatures to high temperature materials and wellbeing from hot surfaces (14″x14″x12.4″) — Optional HEPA and Carbon channel for inadequately ventilated work zones — Pre-amassed and aligned at Fusion3’s manufacturing plant for ideal execution — Modular segments and helpful access to the inside for simple upkeep and adjusting — 4.7″ Color contact screen — Automated bed leveling - Warranty: A 2 year limited warranty is offered on this printer for any minor damages or replacements that might need to be fixed. Software Included: Simplify3D Creator works with Windows; Mac; Linux Base Warranty: 24 mo materials and workmanship. For more data; visit http://www.fusion3design.com Highlights In light of combined statement displaying (FDM) innovation; the F410 includes a contort: three tradable printheads with various sizes of expulsion tips. The one you should utilize relies upon the speed and precision of the ideal thing. The F410 incorporates the 0.4mm tip that can set down 20-to 300-micron layers with a resilience of 75 microns. In the event that you require more exactness; you’d utilize the 0.6mm tip that can make 100-to 400-micron layers with a precision of 115 microns. At long last; the 0.8mm tip makes 200-and 500-micron layers with a resilience of around 150 microns. With the diverse printheads; the goals can fit the venture. They cost $160 and can be swapped in around five minutes by relaxing two screws. Of the three; the 0.8mm printhead is the speed evil spirit; with the capacity to set down material as quick as 250 mm for each second — twofold the speed of numerous FDM printers and 66% quicker than the MakerBot Replicator Z18. Indeed; even the 0.4mm printhead produces 110 mm of material for every second. As opposed to moving its own fiber; Fusion3 adopts an open-source strategy that confirms crude materials from outsider merchants. With accomplices like Atomic Filament and 3DXTech; it offers a more extensive assortment of potential outcomes than any single organization can achieve. The accessible materials incorporate nylon; polylactic corrosive; acrylonitrile butadiene styrene; polyethylene terephthalate and acrylonitrile styrene acrylate. There are claim to fame fibers like carbon fiber; fiberglass; polycarbonate; and an adaptable plastic for tubing and electrical conductors. While every one of the materials are suitable for quick prototyping; the nylon fiber is best to make utilitarian parts; and the polycarbonate material can withstand higher temperatures. These crude materials are commonly accessible in high contrast; yet a few; similar to the PLA fiber; have yellow; orange; dim and shocking shine in obscurity items. The fiber goes ahead open spools that are anything but difficult to load and cost as meager as $30 a reel. On the drawback; not at all like with the Leapfrog Xeed 3D; the F410’s single-extruder configuration implies you print the thing’s backings in the meantime out of a similar material. Needed Improvements: Coming up short on the Xeed 3D’s programmed fiber encouraging component; the F410’s fiber is stacked by bending the printer’s feed handle until the point when it gets and is maneuvered into the extruder. Another drawback is that the waste fiber can’t be reused. The printer can make swooping bends; sharp edges and straight edges for an assortment of items. Its yield is utilized in auto sequential construction system installations; model item cases and accuracy impeller sharp edges. Like the Xeed 3D; the F410 has a warmed glass organize for expanding construct consistency; however it comes up short on the Xeed’s rock choice. Prior to printing anything; you’ll have to cover the phase with paste stick to advance bond; a stick accompanies the printer. With a 14 x 14 x 12.4-inch assemble chamber; the F410 is misleadingly substantial. It can suit single things up to almost 40 liters. That is great; however second best to the MakerBot Z18’s 18-inch-tall form chamber; which can make things 4 inches longer than the F410 can. One of the littlest and lightest printers in its class; the F410 is 28.5 x 30.5 x 25.5 inches and weighs 85 pounds. It tends to be set up on a rack or tabletop. Fusion3 moves a $650 coordinating wheeled stand that has an extensive compartment for fiber and devices. Convenience: Rather than the normal level entryway; the F410’s pivoted top opens vertically like a vehicle’s hood; uncovering the fabricate chamber; printhead and fiber spool. All the move makes put on the framework’s 4.7-inch shading touchscreen. It not just shows if the warmers are turned on and the temperature of the extruder and warmed stage; however it is shading coded; with green demonstrating that every ha hit its ideal temperature. On the presentation; you can begin a print work or perform upkeep; such as leveling the stage or running demonstrative checks. Like the Xeed 3D; the F410 utilizes Simplify3D programming. It works with Windows frameworks (Vista to Windows 10); Macs (10.7 or more up to date) and an assortment of Linux appropriations; for example; Debian; Ubuntu and Fedora. On the drawback; there are no telephone or tablet applications that can free the administrator from a work area or journal PC. The program imports standard STL; 3MF or OBJ CAD records; which the product amends for configuration blames; upgrades and cuts into assembling areas. Before any plastic is expelled; the application includes underpins as required and demonstrates a see. Experienced fashioners can fluctuate printing parameters and even diminish how much help material is required; diminishing form times and cutting material expenses. In contrast to the Xeed 3D; the F410 manages without a webcam for remote review of the fabricate’s advancement. It interfaces by means of an Ethernet port; yet it needs Wi-Fi or the capacity to connect the F410 to a workstation with a USB link. While a large portion of its companions let you put a document onto a USB streak drive for fast in and out prints; with the F410; you’ll need to utilize a SD card. Upkeep is insignificant and incorporates clearing out flotsam and jetsam from the past forms and occasionally cleaning the extruder; fixing the printhead; and modifying the F410’s orientation and pressure links. You’ll likewise need to once in a while grease up the Z-hub bars and lead screws. Client Service: The F410 accompanies a two-year guarantee; the best in the business and multiple times the inclusion that MakerBot gives. The organization doesn’t move service contracts yet incorporates lifetime support and moves new parts at expense. Fusion3’s help site incorporates an exhaustive manual and setup guide; tips; and investigating help. The instructional exercise on capitalizing on the Simplify3D programming is a superb method to begin with the F410. The organization has specialists remaining by at its North Carolina plant to answer your inquiries from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. ET Monday through Friday. They guarantee to answer email inquiries inside 60 minutes. materials: Superior: Print Speed up to 250MM/sec and layer goals as low as .05MM 32 Bit Controller gives Automated Bed Leveling; Filament DetectionFaster Speeds and Remote Management Over Your Network 2 Year Warranty — Best In 3D Printing Industry Free Phone and E-mail Technical Support For The Life of The Printer Conclusion: The Fusion3 F410 3D Printer is one of the largest leaders in 3D printing; this product well equipped with some of the latest features on the market. Enjoy some of the best technologies that the world has to offer at an affordable price. Fusion3 F410 3D Printer is a great choice when it comes to 3D printer’s with multiple printing capabilities and enhancements. Originally published at http://3dprintr.club on January 1; 2019.

Creation history and composition,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write Creation history and composition Luxury Cleaning NY · Follow 2 min read · Jan 1; 2019 -- Microfiber looks like regular fabric. But appearances are deceptive Microfiber can rightly be called the apartment cleaning material of the XXI century. Its properties are truly unique; which is why it is so often used to clean a variety of surfaces. From this material; you will learn about the history of creation; composition; characteristics; and applications of microfiber. Microfiber was developed in 1976 in Japan; but its widespread production became possible (and economically viable) only after several years. However; immediately after the invention of this unusual material in all maid service respects; the world appreciated the revolutionary discovery and the opportunities that had opened up. The cleaning services material consists of only two substances — polyester (forming fiber) and nylon (forming the core) in a ratio of 4/1. The resulting tissue has millions of microscopic triangular pores. They quickly absorb water (ten times faster than any other material) and absorb dust using contact electrification. The liquid then evaporates quickly; and the dirt lingers in the pores of the microfiber cloth. The reason why microfiber retains dust so well is the improperly branched structure of microscopic triangular pores. This is what allows it to surpass its counterparts so much — gauze; paper; and various special cleaning materials. Microfiber has such a prefix because it is about 50 times thinner than an average human hair. Because of this; the fabric is very soft and can interact with any surface much more efficiently.

How Marketers Use Redirect Ads to Deceive You,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write Member-only story How Marketers Use Redirect Ads to Deceive You Sometimes bait-and-switch is obvious; but the tactics grow sneakier every day Patrick Berlinquette · Follow 7 min read · Jan 2; 2019 3.3K 12 Illustration: vladwel/Getty Images “R edirection” is a catchall term for a form of bait-and-switch deception used by Google marketers. A helpful ad on Google will match a searcher’s keywords with a relevant landing page; but redirect ads provide counter-messaging and often alternative destinations that go against the search words. For example; if you search Google for “iPhone 6S;” you’re predictably going to be shown an ad for the iPhone 6S. By clicking that ad; you’ll probably land on a page where you can buy one. A redirect ad; however; might twist your search and prompt you with something like this for a Galaxy S6 instead: A very basic form of redirection through a Google text ad In this example; Samsung is trying to swerve the searcher’s intent with counter-messaging and is betting the searcher will question their brand loyalty; click the ad; and convert from Apple to Samsung. It’s one thing to (fairly obviously) redirect an ad in a smartphone search. But what if the redirection was a bit harder to detect? Let’s say the ad and the landing page seemed to validate your expectations and you didn’t realize you’d been redirected until long after you’d parted with your money. Here are two examples where the switch is tougher to spot: An ad promises Jill neutral information about a new cryptocurrency she’s had her eye on. Instead; her click delivers her to a series of landing pages full of fake news that obscure the advertiser’s actual intention to manipulate the coin’s price. Brad searches “Hillary Clinton is awesome” on Google and then browses the web. He clicks on an ad and ends up on a page containing language that subtly provokes racial and religious tensions. (This is what happened leading up the 2016 U.S. presidential election when redirect ads by anonymized hyper-partisan websites that partnered with Google diverted people who clicked on them to imposter or mirror sites that contained falsified or heavily biased stories.)

A Common Mistake Beginner Software Developers make; and How to Avoid it,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write A Common Mistake Beginner Software Developers make; and How to Avoid it Harshdeep Gupta · Follow Published in The Post-Grad Survival Guide · 5 min read · Jan 3; 2019 2.3K 12 Photo by Fancycrave on Unsplash I was just one month into my job as a software developer; fresh out of college. I was warming up to contribute to my team. Somehow; I caught myself having very interesting thoughts while going through the existing code base. My team had built this code base over months and years of effort. As my first task; I had a small bug fix that would help in stabilizing future versions of the service. My team explained the architecture of the service to me and where do we fit in the grand scheme of the larger project. It was on me to find where the code had to be added/deleted or modified to make the bug fix. I started digging through the code base; most of which had been created in the last two years. By no standard; it was legacy code. As I went deeper and deeper into it; I found myself with quite profane thoughts. To say that code was not aesthetically pleasing; would be a mild way to put it. This is how I reacted to my team’s code base: This sucks!!! Yuck; there is two hundred line function here. Who wrote this crap! Oh God; there is an if-else block inside an if-else block. This code is a big hairy mess! eff it. This needs to be rewritten from scratch. I was furious. As I was having these thoughts; a part of me was wondering; could there be a way to make some sense of all this? Were there some things I didn’t know that these senior guys on my team who wrote most of this code. I began to find out. I grabbed the senior guy on my team for a quick chat and started throwing my questions at him. From what I came to know after the discussion was very enlightening for me. The team was aware that code had some maintenance problems. However; the existing code base was in the shape it is for a few reasons. As he went on to explain those reasons to me; I could see why this post makes sense. Read on to find the answer to why when you ask any software developer the quality of code they are working on; the default response is: “It’s a mess”. And also; why building things up from the ground is not a solution in most cases. Code is written for a different reason Most people new to software development; including me; think that code is written for machines. Wrong. Nada. It was written for humans. The machine doesn’t even see the JavaScript code that you write; all they see is a sequence of 0s and 1s. And as the service for my team was being built up; there were real deadlines with deliverables that had to be delivered. Software developers are already very mentally taxed. Somewhere in the pressure to deliver; getting the code to work takes priority over writing super aesthetically pleasing code. A large chunk of code is easier to write and explain to a fellow developer in person; as opposed to hopping from one file to another to make sense of things. These decisions then can remain around for a long time. Production code is battle tested My team gets a lot of incident reports; which sometimes lead to critical bug fixes in the code. An error handling if-else clause here; a try-catch there; and suddenly; the whole code base has grown hairs. This is how code base starts to get messier despite best intentions. This is exactly why rewriting code from the ground up is such a naive idea. This would result in throwing away all the bug fixes and improvements that were made. These were accumulated over the course of months and years; possibly by a user having some real issue. A developer might have spent several hours to fix these bugs once they were reported. What works is the way In the world of business; where there might be clients depending on your product or service. No one cares if your code is refactored to the best possible extent. Every line of code is written to solve a business problem. Ask yourself; what value will your refactoring efforts create? Possibly none; and they might end up introducing more bugs. Plus; is it the best use of your time? The antidote The first step is to recognize the problem. The issue was my ego was thinking it could do a better job than these senior developers who clearly didn’t know how to write production level code. This is a very naive way of thinking; and I have been burnt sufficient times in the past to avoid it now. Just by acknowledging your ego’s presence; you gain a huge advantage over it. Suddenly; it has no place to hide. Acknowledging the problem is one thing; and solving it is another. Below is my way of getting around this knee-jerk reaction. If you have a different way; write it down in the comments section. Get Curious Start to ask why! Why was this piece of code written this way? Who wrote it? Is that person still around; and can I ask this to him/her. What do these guys know that I don’t? What is the problem that that this feature solves? Most of the times; you will be surprised by the answer. Develop Humility This is not a difficult task. In all likelihood; you still have huge amounts to learn no matter where you might put yourself on the ladder. Adopting a growth mindset is what allowed me to put myself in the right state of mind. It liberated me to ask questions without the fear of looking stupid. When you know that you are not supposed to know all the answers; but learn all the answers; asking questions becomes just a triviality. Conclusion It is very easy to think your way of writing code is best; and everyone else’s sucks. Ask three people on how they would split a string into an array of characters; and all would give three different ways of doing it. Probably; all of them are equally good; and something can be learned from all of them. As to dealing with the bad quality code; throwing it away is definitely not the solution. The more business-friendly way would be to start eating the elephant one bite at a time and refactor your way through the code.

You’ve got an amazing idea; you’ve done your research; you’ve talked to friends; and you’ve found the passion. What’s next? Well; regardless of how successful you and your startup will be 12 months from now; one thing is for sure; it will be a great learning experience. This reminds me of what my manager at Google once said to me: “Every time someone tells me it was a great learning experience; I had lost time or money.” This post contains a few lessons I learned in the first year of launching my startup; and I hope that by reading and understanding these lessons; I can save you time; or money; or hopefully both. People Companies are people. The best people; together; make a great company. The most important decision you’ll make is finding a great co-founder. Until you have one; you don’t have a company. Finding a great co-founder is like finding a best-friend who is very different from you. To find one; you can’t go around asking people to be your best-friend; you’ll need time to pass and experiences to go through together to meet someone like that. Right before I left my job to start Employ; my manager told me: “Find someone who is not you…and someone who can do what you can’t do.” Simple; but effective. I met with over thirty potential co-founders and was very lucky and found a great partner in this adventure and have never looked back. We bring different skills to the table; agree on a million things; and also disagree with each other but with utmost respect; always coming to a conclusion that is based on reason and fact. I have a 100 potential ideas that I can work on in the future; I’ll do 101 with my co-founder Amsul. Beyond your co-founder; your first 10 employees will define who you’ll be as a company. One lesson we learned very early is that it’s hard to hire good people; but it’s even harder to fire bad ones. To do this; make sure you never hire someone who is not all-in; don’t hire any part-timers; people who don’t have full conviction in the mission and are in it for the wrong reason (money; equity; title; etc.). But we all make mistakes; not just as founders; but also as employees when we choose the wrong role or company.

Alibaba Open-Sources Mars to Complement NumPy,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write Alibaba Open-Sources Mars to Complement NumPy Synced · Follow Published in SyncedReview · 3 min read · Jan 2; 2019 943 5 “NumPy” is a beloved tool for the huge population of Python users who are mathematicians; engineers; etc. and working deeply in scientific computing. The NumPy Base N-dimensional array package usually contains: a powerful N-dimensional array object sophisticated (broadcasting) functions tools for integrating C/C++ and Fortran code useful linear algebra; Fourier transform; and random number capabilities Alibaba Cloud recently announced that it has open sourced Mars — its tensor-based framework for large-scale data computation — on Github. Mars can be regarded as “a parallel and distributed NumPy.” Mars can tile a large tensor into small chunks and describe the inner computation with a directed graph; enabling the running of parallel computation on a wide range of distributed environments; from a single machine to a cluster comprising thousands of machines. Alibaba Cloud Senior Engineer Xuye Qin introduced Mars from a performance perspective; boasting that “Mars can complete the computation on a 2.25T-size matrix and a 2.25T-size matrix multiplication in two hours.” Mars’ key advantage is its ability to run matrix computation at a very large-scale; a forte that NumPy does not share. The chart below illustrates a simple experiment Alibaba developers ran to test Mars’ performance: They added one and then multiplied the result ((X+1)*2) for 3.6 billion data; then tested the change in computing time as the workers number (number of machines) increased. NumPy; represented by the red cross in the upper left; lags far behind Mars tensors; whose performance approaches ideal values. Mars currently supports a subset of NumPy interfaces; including: Arithmetic and mathematics: +; -; *; /; exp; log; etc. Reduction along axes (sum; max; argmax; etc). Most of the array creation routines (empty; ones_like; diag; etc). What’s more; Mars not only supports create array/tensor on GPU; but also supports create sparse tensor. Most of the array manipulation routines (reshape; rollaxis; concatenate; etc.) Basic indexing (indexing by ints; slices; newaxes; and Ellipsis) Fancy indexing along single axis with lists or numpy arrays; e.g. x[[1; 4; 8]; :5] universal functions for elementwise operations. Linear algebra functions; including product (dot; matmul; etc.) and decomposition (cholesky; svd; etc.). Mars tensor provides a familiar interface much like NumPy. Mars tensor can be installed with the code below: import mars.tensor as mta = mt.random.rand(1000; 2000)(a + 1).sum(axis=1).execute() Mars in distributed version is now available on Linux and Mac OS.

Longer-Term Outlook: 8 Forecasts For The Future,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write Longer-Term Outlook: 8 Forecasts For The Future Scott Belsky · Follow Published in Positive Slope · 17 min read · Jan 3; 2019 -- 4 Forecasting the future is a fun exercise. I like to ask the question; “what about our work and lives today will feel ridiculous ten plus years from now?” What about the future will feel obvious in retrospect? Future forecasts are not an investment thesis because innovations; no matter how exciting they are; won’t happen until the present is ready for them (and this is why the best investors are more insightful about the present than they are about the future). But if you’re a product leader; entrepreneur; or very early-stage investor; future thinking tunes your attention and instincts. It also helps you determine whether a team is attempting to defy a likely outcome or make it happen in a better way. This year I shared some early thoughts on Twitter and solicited other ideas; which I have incorporated and attributed across the 8 themes below. I have also tried to connect some of my work and investments to these themes; which has been an interesting exercise. Disruptive interfaces will wreak havoc across segments of e-commerce and on-demand services. Local city transit will improve by a step-function as government takes over autonomous transportation. A final death blow to analog ways of living as everyday actions are modernized and go mobile. Efficiencies and environmentally-sound practices go mainstream as lower costs and ease of consumption align with environmental consciousness. A new era of personalization that antiquates generalized products and services. A “great awakening” from what we learn about ourselves that will transform our lives. We’ll want stronger relationships; fewer loose connections. Artificial intelligence will protect us more than we ever expected. Let’s jump in. (1) Disruptive interfaces will wreak havoc across segments of e-commerce and on-demand services. This is a trend I have been following for sometime and recently wrote about. As modern interfaces like voice remove options; augmented reality overlays our physical world; and artificial intelligence gains our trust by transcending our own reasoning; defaults will rule our lives and interfaces will compete against one another. I’ve come to call them disruptive interfaces — “drastically simpler and more accessible interfaces that ultimately commoditize everything underneath.” Consider some of the implications as modern interfaces like voice and AR go mainstream: Today; we choose between brands like Uber and Lyft or Energizer and Duracell. But as modern interfaces emerge with powerful defaults; we’ll simply request a ride or refill of batteries and get the (alleged) cheapest and fastest option by default. In such a world; will we look back at the era of so many choices influenced by brand with disbelief? In a world where we’re experiencing our surroundings through the lens of our cameras (or special AR glasses); “in-camera” purchases (offers we receive during augmented reality experiences) will be the new “in-app” purchases. Perhaps we’ll look back 10+ years from now with disbelief that we purchased anything without examining it in 3D? This begs the question of whether hardware providers like Apple and Google will capture a percentage of these purchases? Will we someday look back at the “raw world” before everything was “edited” by AR? Imagine the benefits of augmented reality editing our daily lives to block ads and visibly discourage us from consuming too much sugar or carbs! Will the “raw world” we live in today look antiquated ten years from now? In such a world; will our “phones” simply be mobile battery packs that connect to cellular networks and provide some “local” storage for security and identity purposes only? Other insights: Responding to my thread on Twitter on the topic of AR; Cameron Cundiff noted how ridiculous it will feel “that we used two-dimensional; mostly visual maps for way-finding; without augmentation with virtual landmarks; tactile feedback; and spatial audio.” I agree. We’ll become dependent on navigating life with an augmented layer of information over every person and place we encounter; and this three-dimensional experience will be animated and interactive in ways we can only imagine. I’ve been pretty focused on the building blocks for this future in my role at Adobe. The AR world will require deep integrations between products for 3D rendering (like Dimension); animation (like After Effects); and new products for editing 3D assets and “placing them in the real world” (like Project Aero). And voice-driven worlds will require new tools to design voice interfaces; like AdobeXD (free; check it out!); made possible by our recent acquisition of NYC-based Sayspring. (2) Local city transit will improve by a step-function as government takes over autonomous transportation. I continue to believe that autonomous transportation; at least within city limits; will ultimately become a public utility; much like the subways; running water; and electricity. As transportation data in cities becomes the ultimate asset for scheduling and managing autonomous vehicles; it is much more probable that cities will operate autonomous vehicles and restrict access to main roads than a world where tons of privately owned autonomous vehicles using independent data sets roam the public streets. Of course; many people think that the idea of manual driving will be archaic. My colleague Ed Albro suggested “Driving cars ourselves; except as recreation” will feel ridiculous in the 10+ year timeframe. Ben Gilbert added how strange it will be “that we thought autonomous vehicles could be too dangerous.” And Julia DeWal clearly anticipates an evolution in the design of “streets” as we know them; remarking that we’ll look back in disbelief “that riding a bike or scooter to get around the city was dangerous (manual driving cars; insufficient bike lanes).” If Transportation data becomes a public asset; I can see companies like Remix Software (a company I work with) that focus on bus/vehicle route planning; scheduling; and data management becoming more important players in urban transportation. If autonomous transportation does become more of a public utility; what does this mean for today’s ride-sharing companies like Uber (certainly thriving in the near-term; but will Uber need to build services on top of it’s platform; like UberEats and other services like grocery delivery; to stay differentiated?). (3) A final death blow to analog ways of living as everyday actions are modernized and go mobile. This one goes without saying; but the surprising thing is just how long it has taken for everyday life to be improved through readily accessible technology. In ten years; what about today will we recall with disbelief? “That we plugged in nearly every electronic device around us” — Blaine Sheldon. It is amazing how dependent we are on outlets and wires these days. Will Apple’s AirPower ship in 2019? Rumor is that the delays are due to the unique charging coil designs required to charge different types of products on the same array. “Cables!” — Andrew Allen Let’s hope so; my travel bag makes me feel like a cable salesman these days. “That you needed physical keys to enter homes and exchanged pieces of paper called ‘checks’ as a meta representation of currency” — Antonio Altamirano Well; August (now acquired by Assa Abloy) among many other digital lock companies have allowed us to “go keyless;” now it’s just a matter of mass adoption. Companies like AirBnB could help accelerate this transition. As for “checks;” what a striking remnant of the last century; huh? Personally; I only use mobile deposits at this point and haven’t deposited a check at the bank in years. I am surprised banks haven’t offered a “digital check” service in their apps that essentially acts as a consumer interface for ACH. I’m sure there’s an annoying reason why not. “That you couldn’t vote online.” — jeffrey Amen; my friend. I would imagine the first step here is for a piece of legislation that sets a deadline for a digital voting overhaul. I would love to better understand the obstacles and potential paths. “That IDs where made of fancy cardboard or plastic and that identity confirmation was so broken that personal records were stolen by the millions.” — Antonio Altamirano Identity theft is common these days; and I agree the whole system is broken. I recall a rumor that Apple and Google were both pursuing some form of approval for mobile-hosted government-accepted IDs and Passports. That would be a start. “That we had to type words (letter by letter) actively into a screen rather than speak our thoughts to an AI robot” — Antonio Altamirano No doubt; voice interfaces are here to stay. Brian Roemmele has been one of the earliest vocal visionaries and advocates for voice interfaces. I bet if you ask him; he’ll convince you why we’ll have more interactions with our voice than with our fingers. Even for rather complex applications like Photoshop; the opportunity to engage via voice; coupled with artificial intelligence to further personalize the experience; will change the way we live and work. My Adobe colleague Erik Natzke anticipates life with “no more hard drives; no more album releases (it will just be song by song); no more check-out counters; and no more time-based TV programming.” I agree with this last point; except when it comes to sports and gameshows. Sitting on the board of Cheddar; a post-cable news network that has developed new formats for news and new methods of distribution; I think “TV” as we know it will be entirely different 5–10 years from now. (4) Efficiencies and environmentally-sound practices go mainstream as lower costs and ease of consumption align with environmental consciousness. The stars are finally aligning for environmentally-sound products; customer preferences; and distribution. As it becomes clear that factory farms are prone to bacterial outbreaks and so many foods and cosmetics contain questionable chemicals; we will crave more “natural” ways of living in every respect. This will change what we buy; the food we eat; and unleash a ton of innovation in the form factor of consumer goods. We’ll find it ridiculous that the meat we ate came from actual live animals. Meat alternatives are becoming more popular; but lab grown meat will change everything. Companies like Memphis Meats (not one of my investments; but I wish it was) are growing meat in the labs that is indistinguishable from a killed animal at a cellular level. Once lab-grown meat becomes both safer; more reliable; cheaper; and perhaps even more delicious (not to mention; more humane); the tide will turn. This will also be important for the environment; given that methane and waste runoff from factory farms are among the greatest contributors to environmental calamities. There will be a boom in local produce from urban farms like Bowery Farms and Square Roots that provide a fresher; more reliable; affordable; and often times tastier harvest (achieved through a fully controlled environmental) than traditional farms that ship product far and wide. A ton of venture capital has already been invested in this space; especially as it relates to the “operating systems” for these modern urban farms to function. There will be a shift towards “shipping concentrates versus ready-to-use bottles that are 98% water;” as Jonathan Bostock framed it. I agree that the form factor for beverages (cans and bottles of water-heavy liquids that were made from concentrate before they left the factory) is inefficient. Some companies like Soda Stream have provided an alternative. But a mainstream shift from these “prepared beverages” to a simpler and cheaper concentrate/powder is imaginable. One of my portfolio companies nearing launch tackles a number of common everyday items (like mouthwash; for example) that are currently distributed in plastic-heavy and expensive bottles but could be distributed in far more economized and concentrated ways. We’ve long known about the concept of an individual’s “carbon footprint;” but the consumer-friendly options to manage it have been limited. This will change; as such products become cheaper and more desirable. Within 3–5 years; the majority of the prepared food we order from delivery networks like UberEats and GrubHub; or modern food brands like sweetgreen; will come from commissaries; not actual restaurants. The notion of fulfilling food orders at peak times from busy street-level restaurants optimized for hospitality not delivery is ridiculous; and yet it is today’s status-quo. In the not-so-distant future; most restaurants will consider their storefronts as flagship experiences for their brand; and will scale their higher-margin revenue from fulfilling and delivering orders out of commissaries; operated by third-parties or “collo-commissaries” shared with a few other restaurant brands. These third-party brands will compete with “house brands” that the big delivery platforms create and fulfill on their own. (5) A new era of personalization that antiquates generalized products and services. The ultimate promise of personalized experiences from artificial intelligence has; thus far; been mostly limited to advertising and ad-supported product experiences. Sure; there are smattering of other applications in medicine and your Netflix queue; but I am surprised by how much of daily life is still generalized as opposed to personalized. Online stores still show us every category; restaurants give us menus despite our allergies and diets; and we still become enamored by mass brands. How might artificial intelligence transform our everyday life experiences that would make today’s way of living look utterly ridiculous? Diets and health routines will become ultra personalized. Clay Hebert suggests we will will look back in disbelief “that we were all searching for the ideal one-size-fits-all diet vs. something individually customized.” “Same for drugs and supplements;” he adds. “You’ll take a pill with your name on it; customized for you. We all will.” Whether it is vitamins; diets; medical treatments; workout routines; or your shampoo and soap; the era of personalization will render all of these mass market brands obsolete. With insights about what makes each of us unique; we’ll opt for the personally tailored option of everything. Your mobile food and grocery apps will only display personalized menus (excluding any ingredients you’re allergic to; and taking diet into consideration). One of my investments; Pinto has spent years analyzing and classifying every type of produce and packaged good you’d find in a grocery store; and has used this data to enable companies like Whole Foods to offer a personalized experience to patrons. Imagine; as the interface of shopping changes through new mobile grocery apps or augmented reality; using this data combined with your own preference data to make the entire shopping experience tailored to you. If you’re Gluten Free; every experience and menu you’ll see will be Gluten Free. Education will finally become tailored to the individual. Brian Guenther shared his conviction that we’ll look back in disbelief “that a factory model of education; unpersonalized and based on static content; was an acceptable model for educating our children.” I hope he’s right. If teachers could deliver a more personalized curriculum; where every digital “text book” adjusts using ai to accommodate each student’s strengths and weaknesses; I think such tech would unleash entirely new (and more effective) forms of education. More brands will emerge designed for micro audiences. As some of you know; I’ve had a long-standing fascination in microbrands.” I wrote about this back in March in a post called “Attack of the Micro Brands” and the topic has since been explored in the Wall Street Journal in an article called “Why You’re Buying Products From Companies You’ve Never Heard Of” by Christopher Mims. This is a major commerce trend that impacts the full “stack” of the design; production; marketing; and distribution of consumer products. I’ve made a few bets in this space over the years like Warby Parker (glasses); Outdoor Voices (everyday athletic apparel); Roman (men’s health care); Smalls For Smalls (pet food); FridaBaby (products for babies and moms); and have also been fascinated by the “picks and shovels” companies powering this trend like Assembled Brands (provides tailored financing); Lumi (packaging and logistics); among others. I think we’ll see a lot more of this in the year ahead. (6) A “great awakening” from what we learn about ourselves that will transform our lives. Illustration by Oscar Orozco; 99U I think we’ll look back at the next 5–10 years as a “great awakening” of sorts for our understanding of our bodies; psychology; and decisions. We’ll realize how blind we were to ourselves; ignorant of caloric intake; nutrient absorption; chemical exposure; UV light exposure; and the list goes on. Once we have accurate and real-time measurements; and understand the ramifications; we’ll have a new level of awareness that will change how we live. As we reflect; we’ll find it ridiculous “that we were willing to accept the health risks of sleeping less than 7 hours every night” ( Ben Gilbert ); that “soda was legal for kids under 18” ( Vitaly Gordon ); “that we had to go to a doctor/hospital to get our vitals” (Steve Kaliski ); and that we “dieted without real-time body feedback (thinking blood/sugar/hormones)” (Andreas Klinger ). The media we consume; and the frequency in which we consume it; will become a more conscious choice. We will also become hyper aware of how we spend our time and where we allocate attention. The fact that our devices now count minutes spent in apps (and proactively cut us off); coupled with the (long awaited) mainstream interest in “quantified self” will have a big impact on what sources of news/media/info/entertainment we seek; for what price; and under what terms. Our personal lives and decisions will become more informed by data and less governed by instinct. I have a good friend who once told me about his dating spreadsheet; where he attempts to understand what worked and didn’t work on dates and in relationships so that he could better understand the patterns. It sounds crazy; but perhaps it will feel just as crazy in ten years to make any important life decision without data analysis? One of my portfolio co’s; Airtable; is reimagining the “spreadsheet” to be a more intelligent; customizable; and interactive way to track and analyze any kind of data. Among Airtable’s open source templates you’ll find airtables for tracking your pet’s medical history; apartment hunting; your favorite books; and many more. With consumer-friendly tools that pack the power of deep data analysis; the possibilities are endless. (7) We’ll want stronger relationships; fewer loose connections. No doubt; the state of social networking has degraded into a small number of mass-adopted applications driven by vanity and FOMO. Under the hood; most social networking and media products that proliferate our lives are optimized to keep us growing our networks and scrolling mindlessly through never-ending updates. As a result; we’ve ended up with larger loosely connected networks that provide more noise than signal for what actually matters to us. But something is changing in our desires and tolerances. We’re starting to mock these platforms; limit our time with them; or all-together delete our accounts. Perhaps it is our natural biological response to a superficial stimuli that has started to deteriorate our collective happiness and productivity? I anticipate (and hope) that the social networks of the future focus more on the problems to solve as opposed to fighting for our attention. What factors will drive these new social products? Depth > Breadth: Now that we all have LinkedIn and at least one Facebook product; we can summon pretty much anyone’s digital profile with a simple search. We don’t need another network for everyone where people carefully curate and anxiously post content to a massive network of acquaintances at best; stalkers at worst. Instead; we want to learn more about fewer people. We want to know where our closest friends are. We want to make meaningful intros for the people we care about. The early era of social network was all about vanity; as people sought to accumulate “likes” and reach as opposed to meaningful exchange. No wonder “chat” has been called “the next social network.” We want technology to scale our direct connections. We need a product like Path; which came half a decade too early. And we need to rethink core mechanics: this network should be decentralized to some extent; it shouldn’t be ad-supported; it should have some lean-forward defaults for sharing location and recommendations that would only work in a closed and trusted network; and it should offer alternative interfaces like voice (AirPods) and AR (when the time comes). Social tech will become an intimate endeavor- a way to connect with the people most close to us and; more importantly; connect with our own past. Colby Saenz suggested on Twitter that we’ll look back in disbelief; “that we never valued the importance of personal (and private) documenting of our lives/thoughts/ideas.” Modern social products will account for this. (8) Artificial intelligence will protect us more than we ever expected. Finally; for all the talk of the dangers of artificial intelligence; we tend to skip over the fact that identity theft is a raging problem; that data breaches happen every day; that we’re always trying to moderate the impact of tech in our lives; and that spam and scams have become an everyday reality. Artificial intelligence is our best chance at a step-function more peaceful existence. More positivity by default: For all the talk of ai helping convert customers and optimize product experiences; we haven’t thought about the implications of people using ai to better control what comes into their lives. Like Apple’s default options for ceasing notifications on the phone and blocking certain ads by default in Safari; we may choose to empower ai to proactively “protect us” in the future; which will change the game for advertising and media. Imagine setting default preferences on every device at the OS level to not only block ads; but block malicious characters; non-fact-checked content; and certain notifications at certain times based on ai-analysis of your calendar. Lots of innovation to come here. More productivity: When I was in Tokyo recently; I spent some time with journalists and customers that were asking about how ai would replace creative professionals and somehow automate creative work. On the contrary; I explained; ai will help us humans focus our energy on the creative part and spend less time on everything else in-between. All of the work we’re doing at Adobe using artificial intelligence is intended to reduce the mundane; repetitive; and annoying parts of the creative process. I think this is generally how ai will be used: to not only automate the mundane; but also to unleash our uniquely human capabilities. Fewer mistakes: Seth Godin recently suggested in a post that; despite all the technological advance; our devices still default to 3am when scheduling a meeting at 3; lets us leave a $5;650 tip if we accidentally put our PIN in the card reader when it asks for the tip amount; and so on. His point is: “Are you sure” is something that humans know to ask but machines don’t. Ai should solve this in the coming years. Data will become a natural resource: Will the oceans of data that power artificial intelligence be classified as a natural resource the enriches its citizens; much like oil is managed in countries like Norway? If it is a natural residue of our everyday activity; why shouldn’t it belong to society? Hey; who knows? These future forecasting exercises are fun; if nothing more. They spark conversation and debate with people you can learn from; so bring it on.

Understanding TypeScript Basics,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write Understanding TypeScript Basics Cem Eygi · Follow Published in codeburst · 4 min read · Jan 3; 2019 275 Photo by Mimi Thian on Unsplash Javascript is a flexible programming language. People who are familiar with programming languages like Java; C++; may have difficulties in using Javascript. Those languages are object-oriented; unlike classic Javascript (ES5). However; Javascript has evolved a lot in the last years. We are now able to write object-oriented JS code; with ES6. (If you don’t know ES6; click here for more). But there is also another way with additional features: Typescript. NOTE: In order to understand Typescript; you need to have at least some basic knowledge of Javascript and Object-Oriented Programming. What is this Typescript? Typescript can be explained as a superset of Javascript. It means that every Javascript (also ES6 & newer versions) code is valid Typescript code; but Typescript comes with some additional features: Strong-typed variables Object-oriented programming In Typescript; we can define a variable’s type with the strong-typing feature like we define a variable in Java or C++. Additionally; we are able to write object-oriented code with Typescript. Another important point is that Angular uses Typescript. So if you want to learn Angular; it’s an advantage to know some Typescript first. Let’s see how to start using Typescript… Installation Before we can use Typescript; we need to install it on our computer. We can install Typescript with NPM; so if you don’t have Node.js installed on your machine; you can download it from here. Node.js official website After the installation is completed; go to your terminal and type node -v to check the version: Installing Typescript Now you can install Typescript with NPM. Again from your terminal; type the following command to install Typescript: npm install -g typescript This command will install Typescript globally so you can use it in any project. After the installation completed; you can verify it with tsc -v . Now you can start using Typescript. Create a new file from your code editor and the extension of the file must be .ts. NOTE: Typescript files have a .ts extension. Browsers don’t understand Typescript code; so later it needs to get translated to Javascript. tsc yourFileName.ts This command creates a Javascript file automatically and translates your Typescript code JS. Strong Typing Let’s move on with the main features of Typescript. Different from JS; we can define the types of our variables as number; string; boolean; array; any and much more. Below you can see some examples of strong typing: let name: string;       // for strings let age: number;        // for any kind of numbers let isChecked: boolean; // true or false let data: any;          // can be changed later to any type let array: number[];    // array of numbers Object-Oriented Features Class & Interface Another important feature of TS is that we can write object-oriented code. For example; we can define classes and interfaces: class Student {   firstName: String;   lastName: String;   studentId: number; getGrades() {       // some code   } } We have created a Student class and later we can create instances with the new keyword: let student = new Student();     // an instance of Student class After assigning the Student( ) object; we don’t need to declare its type again. It will be done automatically by Typescript. Constructors In Object-Oriented Programming; we have an important method called constructor( ). Every class has actually a default constructor method; and it is called when we create an instance of that class: class Student {   firstName: String;   lastName: String; constructor(firstName?: string; lastName?: string) {     this.firstName = firstName;     this.lastName = lastName;   } getGrades() {           // some code   } } The question mark makes the parameters optional. Access Modifiers In Object-Oriented Programming; access modifiers are being used for restricting or allowing to access the variables of a class from outside. There are 3 types of access modifiers: Public — Allows access from outside of a class Private — Doesn’t allow access from outside of a class Protected — Allows access only within a class and its derived classes All members of a class are Public by default; this is also an interview question :) So we can (and should) restrict access from outside by adding the private keyword to a class’s members: class Student {   private firstName: String;   private lastName: String; constructor(firstName?: string; lastName?: string) {     this.firstName = firstName;     this.lastName = lastName;   } getGrades() {           // some code   } } Javascript is evolving and will continue to evolve. Typescript is just one of the branches. I hope now you have a better understanding of Typescript; if you have any questions; don’t hesitate to ask them in the comment section.

Three Stories Every Entrepreneur Should Know,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write Member-only story Three Stories Every Entrepreneur Should Know Joe Procopio · Follow 5 min read · Jan 2; 2019 994 7 Storyboard for Breaking Bad; and we all know how that ended. Image from Uproxx. What would you say your company does? It seems like a simple question that should have a simple answer; but that’s rarely the case. Here’s something I’ve done over my 20+ years as an entrepreneur to keep everyone focused on the tasks at hand while also keeping an eye on the future. Entrepreneurs usually blur the lines of what their startup is; what it will be; and what it should be. This is fine until you try to start planning around those stories. At that point; you need to be asking: What are the priorities today and how do we execute on those priorities without mortgaging the future? The reverse question is just as important: How much time do we spend working on those new things that aren’t generating revenue yet? The Three Story Rule Every startup should have three stories; loosely related to the three arcs most storytellers use in episodic storytelling. An easy way to think about it is a television series. When you watch an episode of a TV show; the writers are usually working on three storylines: Story A: Story with an arc that begins and ends in this episode (or maybe a two-parter). Story B: Story with a longer arc that lasts a few episodes or more. This current episode will advance the plot of Story B in smaller increments; and maybe drop a twist in here or there. Story C: Story with a much longer arc; maybe out to the end of the season or the end of the series itself. This current episode might not advance Story C at all; or it may just drop a few hints. At the end of the season or the series; you’ll be able to look back and piece Story C together; but that won’t be easy or even possible in real time. Now let’s take that story strategy and apply it to your startup; and I’ll use my most recent startup as an example. Story A: Right Now Story A is what your company is doing today that is generating revenue; building market share; and adding value to the company. Story A is about this fiscal quarter; this fiscal year; and next fiscal year.

The Mysterious ESP-EYE Development Board from Espressif?,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write The Mysterious ESP-EYE Development Board from Espressif? Alasdair Allan · Follow 2 min read · Jan 2; 2019 126 Sometimes new boards pop up on the radar almost entirely out of the blue; like the new Espressif ESP-EYE has done. This one made its way into the hands of Jean-Luc Aufranc; from the CNX Software blog; over the Christmas vacation. The front of the ESP-EYE board. (📷: CNX Software) “…this is Espressif’s new AI development board featuring voice wakeup; as well as face detection and recognition. It has been built around our flagship chip; ESP32; and it is also equipped with a 2-Megapixel OV 2640 Camera; Microphone; 4 MB Flash; 8MB PSRAM; Micro USB and LED lights on a 21mm × 41mm board.” On the face of it; this is an intriguing addition to Espressif’s product lineup. With most of the major machine learning tools being heavily optimised for Arm-based architectures; Espressif with its Tensilica-based chips is in danger of being left behind when it comes to machine learning on the edge. One of the reasons I was so excited by Seeed Studio’s Air602 module released late last year is that it’s a price comparable ESP8266 competitor that’s built on Arm. The rear of the ESP-EYE board; with the ESP32 chip visible on the left. (📷: CNX Software) On the surface; the board itself looks a lot like a neater; more finished version of the prototype Ai-Thinker CAM board we saw towards the middle of last year; as well a few of the other ESP32-based camera boards I’ve seen. What’s different here is of course that this is; presumably; going to be an “official” Espressif product and that implies a better level of software support than we’ve seen before. But; at least right now; there doesn’t seem to be any details of the software stack they’re using on the board; although it’s likely to be their own ESP-WHO framework. Which is sort of interesting. In fact; there really doesn’t seem to be many details of the new board at all; there certainly isn’t any information available on the Espressif website. Beyond the handful of boards that got sent out to the community over the Christmas break; the new board hasn’t made it into more general circulation. It isn’t yet for sale; and there is no word on pricing or even a release date. So; now all I have to do is figure out how to get my hands on one…?

Gradient Descent,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write Gradient Descent It is a slippery slope; but promise it gets better at the bottom4 Hamza Mahmood · Follow Published in Towards Data Science · 5 min read · Jan 3; 2019 -- tl;dr Gradient Descent is an optimization technique that is used to improve deep learning and neural network-based models by minimizing the cost function. In our previous post; we talked about activation functions (link here) and where it is used in machine learning models. However; we also heavily used the term ‘Gradient Descent’ which is a key element in deep learning models; which are going to talk about in this post. Definition and Nomenclature Gradient Descent is a process that occurs in the backpropagation phase where the goal is to continuously resample the gradient of the model’s parameter in the opposite direction based on the weight w; updating consistently until we reach the global minimum of function J(w). To put it simply; we use gradient descent to minimize the cost function; J(w). Fig 1: How Gradient Descent works for one parameter; w An analogy could be drawn in the form of a steep mountain whose base touches the sea. We assume a person’s goal is to reach down to sea level. Ideally; the person would have to take one step at a time to reach the goal. Each step has a gradient in the negative direction (Note: the value can be of different magnitude). The person continues hiking down till he reaches the bottom or to a threshold point; where there is no room to go further down. Mathematics Let’s formalize the analogy into an algorithmic form. We compute the activation for the incoming parameters; we carry out feedforward by taking the weighted sum of the activation and its bias. We extract the error term of the output sample by subtracting it with the actual ‘target’ value. The gradient descent process is exhibited in the form of the backpropagation step where we compute the error vectors δ backward; starting from the final layer. Depending upon the activation function; we identify how much change is required by much change is required by taking the partial derivative of the function with respect to w. The change value gets multiplied by the learning rate. As part of the output; we subtract this value from the previous output to get the updated value. We continue this till we reach convergence. In the code below; I wanted to highlight how one can write a simple code to get a visualization of how gradient descent works. Running this piece of code; using the Tanh activation function; we will observe the current value of 10 go down to a value of 8.407e-06 on the 10000th iteration; which is our global minima. Fig 2: A simple implementation of gradient descent; based on the Tanh activation function There are a number of gradient descent algorithms out there. I’ll mention a few below: Batch Gradient Descent Stochastic Gradient Descent Mini-batch Gradient Descent If you want to go into the technicalities of the more recent ones; I highly recommend going through Sebastian Ruder’s article on the topic. Exploding & Vanishing Gradients In deep networks or recurrent neural networks; there are two known issues explained in a paper by Pascanu et al (1994) — of exploding and vanishing gradients. This happens when are doing back propagation as we iterate through the code; there is a chance that the normal of the weight matrices going beyond 1. If this happens; the gradient explodes but if the normal is below 1; the gradient vanishes. If we want to visualize exploding gradients; you will encounter at least one of the problems: The model will output ‘Nan’ values The model will display very large changes upon each step The error gradient values are consistently above 1.0 for each node in the training layer. Solution: Gradient Clipping The solution to the exploding and vanishing gradient problem; we introduce gradient clipping; where we ‘clip’ the gradients if it goes over a certain threshold represented by a maximum absolute value. Hence; we keep the neural network stable as the weight values never reach the point that it returns a ‘Nan’. In a coded implementation removing the clipped gradients leads to ‘Nan’ values or infinite in the losses and fails to run further. The code below showcases how to perform gradient clipping. Given that we have a vector of losses and a learning rate; we are able to compute a vector of gradients which are next clipped based on a maximum L2-norm value; which in this case I have written as 5. So at the end of the day; when a question is posed to data scientist of what optimizer to use in order to minimize loss; there are a couple of factors to consider: The size of the training dataset How quickly do we need the training data to achieve convergence Link of the paper referenced: http://proceedings.mlr.press/v28/pascanu13.pdf Conclusion In this write-up; we covered a number of things: We covered what is Gradient Descent is and how it works in a neural network. We went through the mathematics involved and implemented a coded version of it. Lastly; we covered the issues involving gradient descent in the form of the vanishing and exploding gradient problem and discussed the solution for it using gradient clipping. In the next lecture; we will explore what activation functions are and how they are crucial in deep learning models; so stay tuned for that! Spread and share knowledge.

Product Hunt Radio: Living phone-free in Silicon Valley and the future of music tech,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write Product Hunt Radio: Living phone-free in Silicon Valley and the future of music tech Ryan Hoover · Follow Published in Product Hunt · 3 min read · Jan 2; 2019 80 3 With Justin Kan and Ranidu On this episode I’m visiting Atrium’s headquarters in SoMA in San Francisco to chat with two serial entrepreneurs; Justin Kan and Ranidu. Justin Kan’s career blew up in the mid-2000s when he started livestreaming himself 24/7 on Justin.tv; a Y Combinator backed startup that he co-founded. Justin.tv eventually turned into Twitch and sold to Amazon for nearly a billion dollars. He has gone on to found multiple startups since then; including Exec; Whale; and now Atrium. Ranidu has a unique background. Before jumping into tech; he rose to fame as an R&B and hip-hop artist (check him out here). He went on to join Google before founding the first of many startups; many of which have been centered around his passion for music. We talk about a few of them including The Drop; The Artist Union; and Audius; a decentralized audio distribution platform he started earlier this year. In this episode we talk about: What they’ve learned from building products and startups; what lessons they would give to entrepreneurs starting out today; and how the startup and investing landscape has changed. Justin explains why he says that 2010–2013 was the “sweet spot” for building and scaling a company in the Bay Area. We talk about whether distributed teams make sense due to the escalating cost of living and the battle for talent in San Francisco. Whether an Apple Watch can replace your smartphone. Justin talks about how he survives in Silicon Valley without a phone; how going phone-free has changed how he works and lives and why he compares compulsive smartphone use to an addiction. He says a smartphone is a “Juul for your mind.” We’re all big music fans; so we also talk about artists we’ve been loving recently; why the lines between music genres are being blurred; and the economics of creating music for artists. We also discuss some of their favorite products including a gratitude journal app that will improve your mental health; a “social network for athletes;” and a tool to help organize your tasks at work. We’ll be back next week so be sure to subscribe on Apple Podcasts; Google Podcasts; Spotify; Breaker; Overcast; or wherever you listen to your favorite podcasts. Also; big thanks to our sponsors; GE Ventures; Rally Rd; and AngelList for their support. 😸 Quotes from This Episode “We [at Atrium] have some resources; [we] have expanded; but measuring your company’s success in headcount is like measuring an airplane in weight; so it’s not exactly the right measure of success.” — Justin “As an independent artist today; it takes between three months and eighteen months between the time you stream my music to get paid; and we [at his new company Audius] think that’s wrong in 2018.” — Ranidu “I think the sweet spot [to build a company in the Bay Area] was in 2010 through 2013 or so; where the costs were relatively much lower on the startup salary side. Now your million dollars is good for hiring two machine learning engineers.” — Justin “A lot of days [in my gratitude journal] I write about how awesome it is to live in San Francisco and have all these resources and friends. Life here is great and I think we get caught up in the little bit that is bad and think that everything is bad. To hate on San Francisco is very fashionable.” — Ranidu Companies and Products Mentioned in This Episode Apple Watch — The most powerful and advanced smart watch yet. The Artist Union — Discover and support the next generation of artists. Atrium — Legal services for startups; powered by machine learning. Audius — The future of music streaming on the blockchain. Five Minute Journal — The simplest; most effective way to be happier every day. Headspace — Learn to meditate and live mindfully. Monday — Simplify the way your team works. Pacemaker — DJ with artificial intelligence from your Spotify. Strava — Run and cycling tracking on the social network for athletes. The Drop (RIP) — EDM discovery community.

Designing With the 2018 iPad Pro,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write Designing With the 2018 iPad Pro Levi Patton · Follow 4 min read · Jan 3; 2019 772 3 I’ll be to the first to admit that I’m kind of impulsive. And while picking up a new 11-inch iPad Pro definitely qualifies as an impulse purchase; it’s impressive utility as a design tool has more than compensated for some of the post-impulse-purchase guilt. Until now; I’ve never owned an iPad or ever really had the need or desire to own one. So when I picked up the 2nd generation Apple Pencil and started doodling on one of the new iPads to kill time in the Apple Store; my expectations were pretty flat. It was another super pretty piece of Apple glass with a $120 stylus. Oh; it costs another $200 to add on the ‘smart’ keyboard? Classic Apple play. Fun to mess around with on an Apple Store errand; but not something I’d actually consider shelling out for. I sketched a couple quick figures; some portraits; and other random doodles. Whoa; this thing was pretty sleek. The interaction between the pen and the screen was impressively smooth. The sensitivity of the stylus captured my sketchy/messy drawing style surprisingly well. I’ve always loved drawing with pen and paper; but have never really transferred over to digital mediums because you tend to lose that organic feel and style. Not the case with this magic little slate. Then I tried sketching out a couple basic wireframe shapes. I drew a crooked box that I didn’t like; so I double tapped the pen to bring up the eraser in a seamless and intuitive motion; corrected the mistake; and continued on with the sketches. Uh oh. I was officially delighted. Needless to say; I went home with the iPad with the insurance of an extended holiday return policy. I had a month and a half (instead of the usual two weeks) to explore and decide if it was worth the hefty price tag. Pack your bags Frodo; this was going to be a journey. For the next couple of weeks; I explored a huge range of design-oriented apps to put the iPad to the test. Right off the bat; it became clear that some of the most impressive apps (unsurprisingly) belong to the Adobe family. Adobe Capture Adobe Comp Adobe Draw Adobe Sketch Spark Post Each of these has its own impressive utility for illustrating and designing. They’re free and integrate with each other really nicely. For instance; you can use Adobe Capture to snap a picture and quickly generate a palette based on the colors in the image and export it to your color library in Adobe Sketch. Adobe Comp works as a quick and efficient wireframing tool for easily creating low to mid-fidelity wireframes: Adobe Draw and Adobe Sketch are both killer apps for drawing and painting. You have a ton of control over your brush tools and pallet; and; there are intuitive finger gestures for undoing and redoing strokes and controlling the canvas. Again; the thing that has impressed me the most with the iPad and this new generation of drawing/painting apps; is the how well these tools are able to capture an organic style and to do so in a way that doesn’t feel overly digital or processed. Something else I’ve encountered in working on illustrations and designs with the iPad is how it has fundamentally changed my approach in the creative process. For instance; when I paint with oils; oftentimes I’ll have an idea for adding some shading or accents on a certain part of the painting. If I execute the idea and I end up not liking the result; I can sometimes undo the effect with more paint—at the expense of lost time—but it often ends up completely changing the feel of the painting. This creates a kind of risk/reward dynamic that directly influences decisions when drawing or painting. I’ll often end up being more conservative at the expense of experimenting on a potentially cool effect. The super impressive ‘Procreate’ is another illustration app that shines on the new iPad pro. Being able to manipulate layers makes experimentation easy. If you don’t like the result; just delete the layer or undo the strokes. Painting; sketching; or designing on the iPad is a distinct experience in the sense that nothing feels permanent. The shortcuts and gestures for ‘undoing’ are seamlessly integrated into your workflow; and it encourages experimentation without fear of repercussion or lost time. This is true for painting and illustration; but also when sketching out wireframes or designing infographics. The ability to easily make annotations can breathe a more ‘flowy’ organic feel into wireframes and deliverables. The ability to move; merge; change; and rearrange so fluidly makes designing on the 2018 iPad Pro an absolute delight. With the cutoff for return quickly approaching; I think this impulse purchase has earned its permanent place in my quiver of design tools; and; it will be an awesome asset for creativity and design moving into 2019.

This Cartridge Turns Your Game Boy Into a Wireless Controller,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write This Cartridge Turns Your Game Boy Into a Wireless Controller Cameron Coward · Follow 2 min read · Jan 3; 2019 -- Emulators and remasters are both great ways to step back in time and play your favorite retro video games. But; your controller can definitely hold you back — nobody wants to play Dr. Mario with a computer keyboard; after all. Even if you have a controller with the correct layout; subtle differences in button feel can completely ruin the experience. But if you have a Game Boy; you can now use it as a wireless controller thanks to this special cartridge. The Wireless Gameboy Controller Device is a cartridge that’s compatible with the original Game Boy; the Game Boy Pocket; the Game Boy Color; the Game Boy Advance; and the Advance SP. It’ll turn your Game Boy of choice into a wireless controller that works with a PC; a Raspberry Pi; or a GameCube. That means you can play a game like Pokémon Red or Blue through RetroPie running on a Raspberry Pi; while using an actual Game Boy Color as the controller! The cartridge works by making your Game Boy think you’re playing an actual game. There’s nothing on the Game Boy’s screen; but the “game” still accepts all of the button inputs. Every 2ms; it checks for a button press; and sends those button presses to a wireless receiver plugged into your computer or Raspberry Pi. The receiver refreshes every 8ms; so there shouldn’t be any noticeable input lag. Simply put; it’s a streamlined solution for your using your Game Boy as a wireless controller. Stock is limited; but you can snag a Wireless Gameboy Controller Device from insideGadgets’ Tindie store for $39 plus shipping. Cartridges are available in gray and clear; and include the wireless USB receiver. Sign up to discover human stories that deepen your understanding of the world. Free Distraction-free reading.

Electrify Me: The Lightning Network,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write Electrify Me: The Lightning Network Digital Doppelgangers · Follow Published in Coinmonks · 8 min read · Jan 2; 2019 -- 4 The lightning network seems to be the answer to all Bitcoin and blockchain related ills: the ideal alternative to the clogged; clumped; over-crowded payment processing ecosystem we’re currently saddled with; with its slow speed; high transaction fees and all-around; ever pervading inefficiency. Surely; with Bitcoin being the natural evolution of currency (and by extension; humanity itself); improved levels of usability should freely follow in its wake — however; as is often the case within the launch of new technologies; the final infrastructure does tend to lag several steps (or miles) behind. With Visa able to process 24;000 transactions per second; Bitcoin Cash 61 and Bitcoin a mere 7 transactions per second; its inadequacy is glaringly obvious to all members of the crypto community. The lightning network grew into prominence during the more nascent architectural days of 2017; before its official; full-blooded incarnation in March 2018. Since then; particularly in recent months; it has travelled swiftly from strength to strength. One of the key players — and early adopters — within the lightning network space is Bitfury. Bitfury is “one of the largest full-service blockchain technology companies in the world”; providing both software and hardware solutions for businesses; governments; organizations and individuals to securely transfer assets across the blockchain network. Interestingly; Bitfury have been the first to fully implement a lightning-network based coffee-purchasing system. Their lightning network engineering team; known as LightningPeach; partnered with payments startup Paytomat in order to launch the lightning network via their platform — an all-around successful integration; garnering further faith in the Lightning Network; and pushing Paytomat up the rankings of revolutionary retribution platforms. 2018 achievements… Lightning Labs; the infamous proponents of the Lightning Network; have achieved a significant amount over the past year: regardless of Bitcoin’s dips; its ability to travel sideways; upside down and fling itself askance in every other direction; the lightning network itself has gone from strength to strength; unfazed by market volatility. November saw the network top 4;000 nodes and before burgeoning to uphold over $2 million value of bitcoin; its capacity continuing to rise after the spiral of BTC; experiencing an increase of almost 300%. Yes; it’s still possible to remain profitable during a stark; bleak crypto midwinter. For instance; the number of crypto ATMs around the world kept growing steadily; with 209 machines opening around the world in December. Canadian BTC mining company Hut 8 claimed a record high $13.5 million for Q3 2018; and Japanese IT giant GMO reported that its crypto businesses; including mining equipment production and its crypto exchange; gained 2.6 billion yen ($22.8 million) during the same period (although some fraudulent dabbling may have been involved). Open Node; a well-seasoned; dynamic member of the lightning network conglomerate; has begun to painstakingly facilitate the launch of the ideal bitcoin payment processing system; negotiating its widespread acceptance with as many merchants as possible; including Starbucks and Tesla; according to Tim Draper’s excited tweet last month. OpenNode charge a transaction fee of 1%: as far as revenue generation goes; it’s hardly outlandish; particularly when stacked beside a successful; all-encompassing payment network. Top Lightning Network Users of Q4; 2018: Bitrefill: A website specialized in providing top-ups for cell phone lines and various gift cards. Blockstream: A blockchain company dedicated to the development of applications on bitcoin; especially sidechains. Its best-known innovation is Liquid HodlMonkey: a company dedicated to selling clothes with crypto-related designs TorGuard VPN: Company specializing in cybersecurity and VPN service provisioning Living Room of Satoshi: Australian company focused on providing options for the payment of various invoices with cryptocurrencies. So... how does it work? The lightning network's mechanism utilizes the relatively young Distributed Proof of Stake (DPoS) protocol; which allows separation of the voting power and block production; with no risks of a hard fork. The BTC Lightning Network; a second layer payment protocol that operates on top of the BTC blockchain; aims to solve the problems with scalability through the use of additional; separate payment channels — a secure and fast way to carry out transactions between a number of users without the necessity of recording them on the blockchain — until the moment the channel is closed. (You certainly can’t avoid it altogether; of course.) These off-chain payment channels facilitate instantaneous micropayments; and a greater; augmented performance for public blockchains. (We’ll expand onto private blockchains shortly.) According to Jack Zhang; “Pow and PoS are easily centralized; while DPoS represents true decentralization. Moreover; DPoS has the benefit of high efficiency; with little resource consumption”. If we’re to engage in a PoW; PoS and DPoS debate; first we need to establish the facts. DDoS vs. PoW vs. PoS Distributed proof of stake; alongside Proof of Work and Proof of Stake. The latter two are older; more wearied and time-worn hats; squabbled over copiously during the evolution of Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash. All three fall beneath the umbrella of consensus mechanisms; which the blockchain/cryptocurrency sphere relies upon — the oxygen of the industry; so to speak. Cryptocurrency; of course; uses distributed ledgers or blockchains to record information; as opposed to a centralised authority; such as a government or a central bank. In the welcome absence of this entity; it is necessary to rely upon an alternative: the consensus mechanisms; all of which borrow certain components freely from one another. All consensus mechanisms work to achieve one; unanimous goal: make it difficult to attack this network; and profitable to protect it. Achievable — yes. Simple? No. PoW Everyone’s favourite — the sanctified system powering Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash. Miners endeavour to solve a cryptographic puzzle; consisting of the mathematical function (hash). The first mining pool forming a hash with specific properties are remunerated with a few Bitcoins; at estimated 10 minute installments. This acts as proof: they have completed the work required to verify all transactions in a block as valid — the product of their labours is then added to the blockchain. Cons: not energy efficient and lacking in environmental friendliness and adequate sustainability. With PoW; organizations that can afford faster and more powerful processing power usually have a better chance of getting the reward than the others — leading to a more unfair distribution of wealth; which Bitcoin itself was designed to tackle. PoS Ethereum’s considering making a well-timed move over to this one. Why? Because it doesn’t need computers in order to perform repetitive computations; thus presenting itself as a more environmentally friendly; sustainable alternative. PoS replaces miners with validators; in a certain situation wherein they will lock up some of their coins as stake — or a deposit. A group of validators takes turns proposing and voting on the next block; the weight of each validator’s vote depends on the size of its stake. When the validators discover a block which they think can be added to the blockchain; they will validate it by placing a bet on it. The validators will receive a reward in proportion to their bets — we hope. Anyone who holds the blockchain’s base cryptocurrency can become a validator by sending a specific type of transaction to lock up their fund within firm lacerations of security. Also; rewards for the creation of a new block are different: with Proof-of-Work; the miner may potentially own none of the digital currency he/she is mining. In PoS; forgers are always those who own the coins minted — thus drastically reducing the risk of fraud. DDoS Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) is a more efficient form of PoS. DPoS uses a reputation system and real-time voting to achieve consensus. Community members vote for “super representatives” to secure their network — these super representatives (very aptly named) will be rewarded by validating transactions for the next block. Better? Yes. As the DPoS vote is consistently on-going; if a super representative does not comply with regulations or perform well; people in the community can remove their votes; essentially firing the bad representative — they are rendered useless. The super representative must obey all rules and keep the network uptime as high as possible; or face the guillotine: a swift; violent rebuttal from its community members. And the best part? It’s a democratic system. Instead of relying on processing power from a centralized authority; bad actors will lose their position and power within the network; at the network members’ behest. These members will maintain the decentralized architecture of the network; as well as benefiting from its speed and agility. The Power of Micropayments As we’re all aware; the power of micropayments is undisputed. Efficiency is the most mandatory component of a financial ecosystem — and mciryopayments can serve as the missing flame; with the lightning network serving as much needed paraffin. “CryptoGraffitti”; the illusory; as yet unidentified crypto and fintech based artist; following the successful auctioning of a micro-painting depicting a black swan; released a statement extolling the many virtues of a future where “micropayments are omnipresent. Artists paid by the view…writers by the poem…musicians by the listen.” An almost intoxicatingly attractive proposal for any independent content creator — and an achievable goal as well. In recent news… Roger Ver strikes again with what is arguably a barrage of insensitivity; ruthlessly preaching the virtues of Bitcoin Cash; far worthier of the prowess of the lightning network in comparison to its lowly sibling — Bitcoin. Open Node; a prolific lightning network company; has soundly rejected 2.5 million dollars from Roger Ver; to build a protocol on Bitcoin Cash. According to Open Node: “our vision of a better; more open financial system is only possible with Bitcoin.” Cue the sighs of relief from the old religion; crucifix-bearing; holy-water swigging portion of our crypto society; otherwise known as the “HODLers” or “Maximalists”. Bitcoin continues to reign supreme in our hearts and minds. ⠀ A return of the Bitcoin/Bitcoin Cash wars of the past several months? Or another instalment in the battle of investor upon investor? Roger Ver appears reluctant to take on Tim Draper; the principal investor in Open Node; although he remains sceptical of his reluctance to combine BCH with the lightning network. According to Ver: “the Lightning Network would work far; far; far; far better on a system that doesn’t have a limit to the size of the blocks; (like Bitcoin Cash) than it will on BTC.” Point taken — the four “very”s really added some much needed oomph. More slightly negative updates: another ambiguous contributor to the Lightning Network codebase; under the username ZmnSCPxj; has pointed out a stark limitation of this promising network. Its ability to make multi-asset conversions is apparently limited by its current technical design: as the value of trade assets changes dramatically during specified trade windows; cross-asset exchange nodes on the Lightning Network will be exploited to create risk-free American Call Options. According to ZmnSCPxj: “significant liquidity will be tied up in such American Call Options; and they [the channels] find that they will lose funds — especially at times of volatility.” More on this in our next installment; in which we’ll also be addressing the relationship between the lightning network and XRP.

Cryptocurrencies & Chipmakers — A Tale of Two Crises,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write Member-only story Cryptocurrencies & Chipmakers — A Tale of Two Crises Patrick Tan · Follow Published in DataDrivenInvestor · 7 min read · Jan 2; 2019 -- 2 Valentine’s Day chocolates took a weird turn. F or decades; executives at some of the world’s largest chipmakers have enjoyed the lives of corporate fat cats. From business class travel to chauffeured Mercedes-Benz limousine service; these scions of the semiconductor world were riding high on a wave of optimism and global consumption of smartphones hitherto unprecedented and unparalleled. But it seems that the party may be ending in the semiconductor-sphere and not just because of the looming trade war between the United States and China; but because of the laws of physics as well. For decades; Moore’s law; (which is really an observation and not a law in the strict sense); that every two years; the number of transistors in a dense integrated circuit doubles. In other words; chips (not the potato kind) are expected to do more while getting smaller. But the reality has been far different. For the early decades of chip development; Moore’s “law” was actually observed more in its contravention than in its adherence. Chips were becoming faster and smaller at a rate far in excess of Moore’s observations. Think of transistors as tiny little ON/OFF switches; which allow small amounts of current to either pass through them or not. The more transistors a chip can store; the more calculations it can make and the faster these calculations can be made. The simple ON/OFF design and the combination thereof is what makes all the things of modern life possible. From your smartphone to your fridge; almost everything runs on some form of semiconductor — even cryptocurrency mining rigs. Headwinds in the Chipmaking Industry But the drop off in smartphone demand has been a precursor to falling demand for chips. Take Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC)for instance; whose sales growth outlook this year is about half of what was forecast at the start of 2018. And according to data from the World Semiconductor Trade Statistics; 2019 forecast semiconductor growth has been slashed from 4.4% to 2.6% amidst the looming trade war between the U.S. and China as well as slowing Chinese growth. According to another research firm; IC Insights; capital expenditure among semiconductor makers is expected to drop by 12% this year as well. The trend also does not bode well for cryptocurrency rig manufacturers like Bitmain; Canaan; and… -- 2 Written by Patrick Tan 5.4K Followers · Writer for  DataDrivenInvestor General Counsel for ChainArgos; the blockchain intelligence firm made famous for breaking the story that BUSD was unbacked by US$1.4bn Follow,['Cryptocurrencies & Chipmakers — A Tale of Two Crises'],Patrick Tan,https://patricktankt.medium.com/?source=post_page-----982498c9254a--------------------------------,7 min read,Jan 2  2019,https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*fSH4tDeqmv5VfE9aDOlndg.jpeg
Hello World,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write Hello World Brittney Ball · Follow 6 min read · Jan 2; 2019 -- 8 I would first like to Thank You for taking the time out to read my first “official” blog post! Since this is THE FIRST I think I should give a somewhat brief introduction on who I am; why I decided to start blogging; what you can expect from my blog; and why I chose to title my blog “The <B> Word”. I am originally from Washington D.C. (born and raised); but decided to relocate to Charlotte N.C at the beginning of 2018 to start a new life in a city that I was somewhat familiar with. I had heard that the Tech scene in Charlotte had been developing and since my contract with Georgetown University was ending soon I felt like that was the universe giving me the green light to take a chance and start over fresh. I was able to secure an apartment for my boys and I and immediately started the dreaded JOB SEARCH after. I had been meeting with different recruiting agencies; sending out hundreds of resumes; and it always ended with similar if not the same results… “ Dear Ms. Ball; we appreciate you coming in to interview with us but at this time we are looking for a candidate with a little more experience.” Can you say discouraging! I began to doubt myself and my decision to move my little family to Charlotte. One day; I decided to try a different method of getting my foot in the door of one these tech companies. I decided to research companies in Charlotte and find the top five that I would like to work for and look up developers who were already working there on LinkedIn and introduce myself that way! Hey; they say sometimes its not what you know but who you know that gets you in; and what did I have to lose? Luckily; the first developer I messaged on LinkedIn immediately responded back. He informed me that the company he worked for was currently not hiring but he recommended that I join a local meetup group called the “Charlotte Devs”. He said that they might be able to assist me on my job search. I wasted no time joining the meetup group and was added to the slack workspace. I introduced myself right away and shared how the interview process had lowered my confidence and how I really just wanted to find a great company that saw my potential and would be willing to invest in my growth. Moments later I received a private message that reassured me that Charlotte was where I belonged. “ Would you be interested in interviewing for a position here at SKOOKUM?” Ummm; YES PLEASE!!! By this time I had heard amazing stories about the Skookum culture and how it was voted one of the number one places to work in Charlotte. I was soo excited! Ok; let’s fast forward 6 months into my internship at Skookum; which was originally suppose to only be a 6 week contract role (big smile)! At this point I’m full of nerves because the internship is almost over and I didn’t know whether or not I was going to have a job offer in the end. I couldn’t sleep. Anxiety started to set in. I turned to twitter for motivation and to reassure me that “I’VE GOT THIS”. As I sat in bed reading everyones testimonies about how coding had changed their lives I decided to post a tweet to remind myself of how far I’ve came and to let others know that with determination and desperation you can change your situation. I woke up the next morning and my tweet have went viral! I was amazed that what had seemed like such a simple tweet to me resonated with soo many people. This was thousands of strangers telling me how proud they were of me; that they were rooting for me; and had NEVER met me in person. My day had been made.. or so I thought. I went in to work and shared what had happened with a few of my coworkers who were just as excited and shocked as I was. By the end of the day I received the message I had been anticipating…a slack message from the Engineering Director asking to meet with me. I instantly thought “aww man let me find a box to toss my stuff in” LOL. I can’t remember how long we talked honestly because I was soo nervous that it seemed like everything was moving in slow motion and then I heard it… we would like to keep you on FULL-TIME as a Software Engineer!! Tears of joy burned my face because even though my learning journey wasn’t over I had finally found a company that believed in me and wanted to help me grow! A viral tweet and I was brought on full-time that same day!! November 28th was honestly the best day for me in 2018. Since I was now officially a Skookum employee I had decided to share my story with my coworkers since the tweet sparked some curiosity and they were already aware that I had taken a non-traditional route into tech (Self Taught). After hearing my story I was asked if it would be ok to publish my story on the Skookum blog and of course I said “YES”. Since then the article and my tweet have been shared all over the different social media platforms; it’s been featured in different tech newsletters; and shared on other websites. You can read the article HERE. Which brings me to why I decided to start a blog. It wasn’t because I’m a millennial and almost every millennial wants to be a successful blogger LOL. It was because I feel like I have something important to share with others. I want to show people what my journey through tech looks like as a working SINGLE mother; as a minority; and as a woman who happens to be self taught without a college degree. I want to continue to inspire those that may think that they can not succeed by sharing my truths no matter how ugly. I want to show people tech through my eyes. As I learn I will share my methods of learning; the difficulty level; and what I struggled with. I also want to give my thoughts on important nontechnical issues that matter such as diversity and inclusion in tech that often gets swept under the “rug”. Majority of the time when I read tech blogs and feel intimidated because the authors seem so senior and robotic. I can’t relate or really follow what they are trying to teach because it doesn’t seem like they are writing for the newbies. That’s where I plan on picking up the slack (ha ha). My plan is to make this blog the “watering hole” for developers of all skill levels. And now i’ll explain the why I chose to title my blog “The <B> Word”…. It honestly took me two weeks to find a name I liked that correlated with my blogs purpose. It had to be edgy; punny; and simple. After being smothered in brain fog I decided to use one of those name generating websites LOL. The first name that came up was The B Word. I thought “hmm I like it” but how can I incorporate tech? Presto!!! I turned the B into the <B> tag!! Which gave the title soo much more meaning!! I knew that seeing the title peoples immediate thought would shift to the profane word most commonly used to degrade women; and I wanted to challenge that way of thinking by adding a positive twist. The <B> is bold; strong; and demands attention and that’s EVERYTHING I want this blog to be. So there you have it! A brief introduction of what you can expect from my blog in 2019! I hope I piqued your interest and you continue to come back. Thank you for being apart of this journey with me and HAPPY NEW YEAR!

ONEROOT Announces New Economic Model of RNT,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write ONEROOT Announces New Economic Model of RNT ONEROOT · Follow 5 min read · Jan 2; 2019 -- Related video: https://youtu.be/ItZ0D04Gohc Founded in April 2017; ONEROOT is a blockchain technology solution provider focused on the development of underlying technologies. It is committed to building industry infrastructure; breaking the application threshold of blockchain technology and facilitating more external resources to enter the blockchain industry. Over the past year; ONEROOT has successively developed a decentralized transaction protocol R1; a distributed decentralized exchange DDEX; a distributed centralized exchange DCEX; high-performance public chains RNC; a user terminal Touch Wallet and other products; which have won recognition from top international partners in the industry. Mutual benefits and shared achievements are the consistent concept of ONEROOT; of which the core is fair and efficient transfer of value. RNT is the bridge connecting all links of the ecosystem; and therefore has a solid value base. With the rapid development of the blockchain industry; ONEROOT ecosystem continues to expand. As a result; the service targets have become more diversified; and new application scenarios have been emerging. Meanwhile; the functions and positioning of RNT have also changed. To this end; we have refined the application scenarios; clarified the relationship between supply and demand; and explained the value base of RNT from the function aspect. Transaction Scenario Transaction is the most mature application scenario in the blockchain industry and one of the main development directions of ONEROOT. Insufficient liquidity along with high development and maintenance costs is a challenge for all exchange operators. Guided by the concept of mutual benefits and shared achievements; ONEROOT’s trading solutions allow operators holding traffic to quickly deploy distributed exchanges; share transaction data and liquidity; meanwhile; improving transaction efficiency and greatly reducing the cost of R&D and maintenance as well as access to traffic of operators. As DDEX and DCEX bring together more and more exchanges; all participants will win through sharing. Within the ONEROOT distributed trading system; RNT has the following functions: (1) Stake or pay a certain amount of RNT to cooperate with ONEROOT to build DCEX or DDEX; (2) Discounts will be obtained for using RNT to pay transaction fees (see the rules of each cooperative exchange for specific rate); (3) After fully circulated; RNT will be used as the basic token to open trading pairs on all DDEX of ONEROOT; (4) Holding a certain amount of RNT will allow you to apply for token listing on ONEROOT DDEX where all RNT holders will vote. Once passed; the token will start for transaction on all ONEROOT DDEX; (5) RNT holders can participate in the vote for token listing. Public Chain Scenario Public chain is the underlying infrastructure that connects the ONEROOT ecosystem. For this reason; ONEROOT has developed an asset-friendly; high-performance public-chain RNC. By mapping external assets and built-in decentralized exchanges; it is possible to securely and quickly realize the registration; distribution and circulation of assets. This also; breaks the performance bottleneck of Ethereum; which greatly enhances user experiences of decentralized transactions. RNT will serve as fuel to drive RNC operations; including: (1) Be used as Gas when transactions are sent; contracts are executed and other operations are conducted on the chain； (2) When trading on DEX; you can get a corresponding fee discount if you hold a certain amount of RNT; (3) Be used as GAS fees for operations on other chains Technical Services and Ecological Expansion As a leading blockchain technology service company; ONEROOT can provide all-round and reliable support for the demand side. With the continuous increase of partners; the ONEROOT ecosystem will continue to expand; giving RNT a more solid value base: (1) ONEROOT will provide technical services such as decentralized transactions to the demand side without charge. However; in order to protect the rights and interests of users; the demand side needs to stake a certain amount of RNT as a security deposit; (2) Due to limited human resources; ONEROOT cannot provide technical services to all demand sides at the same time. Therefore; users can get priority by paying a certain amount of RNT. This part of the tokens will be directly transferred into the address of the ONEROOT Foundation and be managed by the Foundation. Tips: As a digital business infrastructure; ONEROOT welcomes all merchants to provide services in the ecosystem. However; in order to protect the rights and interests of users; merchants need to stake a certain amount of RNT. The benefits that ONEROOT receives in the ecological cooperation will be returned to the holders of RNT in the form of airdrops. Metaphorically speaking; if a blockchain project is regarded as a human body; tokens are the circulation system that connects various organs; transports nutrients and transmits values. Meanwhile; the economic model is the operating mechanism of the system; which directly determines whether the project can develop healthily. How to design a self-consistent economic model is a proposition that all projects are constantly exploring. The significance of RNT is to rationally distribute relevant benefits so that value can be circulated among all participants to form a fair and efficient business collaboration model. A healthy economic model is not static. While ONEROOT is still a new project and with consideration given to the development of the ecosystem; we acknowledge RNT will face various problems. However; we believe that with the support of the community; ONEROOT team will adhere to the initial and make positive adjustments. At the same time; RNT will also play an irreplaceable role; and continuously enhance the intrinsic value with the support of global traffic. Tips: The total amount of RNT is 400 million and there will never be further issue. Currently; RNT can be traded on dozens of exchanges around the world: ________________ English: Telegram-en/ONEROOT web/R1 protocol Reddit/Twitter/Medium/Linkedin/Facebook/Github Instagram: @onerootnetwork Youtube: @OneRoot Project Korean: Naver blog/Kakao Chinese: Telegram-cn/Weibo Official QQ group: 6644849 Official WeChat account: oneroot_admin Sign up to discover human stories that deepen your understanding of the world.

How To Create A Serverless; Zero Infrastructure; Zero Administration Data Lake With Amazon S3; Amazon Athena and Apache Parquet,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write Get started with pre-built Amazon data lakes How To Create A Serverless; Zero Infrastructure; Zero Administration Data Lake With Amazon S3; Amazon Athena and Apache Parquet Thomas Spicer · Follow Published in Openbridge · 5 min read · Jan 2; 2019 63 If you have read about data lakes they conceptually seem like a viable approach to fusing together all of that organizational data locked away in silos of web; mobile; marketing; social; CRM….systems. In fact; teams are using innovative serverless data lakes to fuel their data analytics efforts using tools like Tableau. Note: If you are wondering “ what is a data lake?”; you can start with our post on the topic. While promising; we know building data lake can seem like a daunting proposition. It is difficult to understand exactly what is needed to get started given all the different; and sometimes costly; options that exist in the market. Getting Started With Data Lakes We are going to describe a serverless solution stack of Amazon S3; Apache Parquet; and Amazon Athena for your data lake. This approach means no infrastructure to build or manage. You also do not need to worry about configuration; software updates; failures; or scaling your infrastructure as your datasets and number of users grow. This will free your team to focus on use cases of data consumption via tools like Tableau; not the underlying system development. Why Amazon S3 and AWS Athena For Your Data Lake? When teams can realize “quick wins”; they can build the confidence needed to establish organizational velocity. This allows teams the ability to explore creating; low cost; low-risk data lakes that allow them to focus on having data at the ready for analysis; reporting; or other business activity. Using AWS offers a number of benefits when creating a serverless stack: Athena is easy to query: Amazon Athena uses Presto; an open-source; distributed SQL query engine created by Facebook. It was optimized for low latency; ad hoc analysis of data. This means you can run queries against large datasets in Amazon S3 using SQL and a wide variety of BI tools like Tableau and Microsoft Power BI. Athena and S3 are cost-efficient by design: With Amazon Athena; you pay only for the queries that you run. You are charged based on the amount of data scanned by each query on S3. You can realize significant cost savings and performance gains by compressing; partitioning; and converting your data to Apache Parquet because it reduces the amount of data that Athena needs to scan to execute a query. Convenience with performance: With Amazon Athena and S3; you don’t have to worry about managing or tuning clusters to get fast performance. Athena is optimized for fast performance with Amazon S3. Combined with data in Apache Parquet format; Athena will efficiently and automatically execute queries in parallel across your data in S3. This will deliver query results in seconds; even on large datasets. Built-in durability and availability: Using Amazon S3 as the underlying data store ensures your data is highly available and durable. Amazon S3 provides a durable infrastructure for the durability of 99.999999999%. Your data is redundantly stored across multiple facilities and multiple devices in each facility. Peace of mind and a huge time saver. Secure: Access to data is controlled using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies; access control lists (ACLs); and Amazon S3 bucket policies. With IAM policies; you can grant fine-grained control to your S3 buckets. By controlling access to data in S3; you can restrict users from querying it in Athena. Athena also allows you to easily query encrypted data stored in Amazon S3 and write encrypted results back to your S3 bucket. Both; server-side encryption and client-side encryption are supported. Get A Code-free; Ready-to-go Serverless Data Lake Stack If you wanted to get started with a data lake but did not have the time or expertise; we have a solution for you. We offer a pre-built data lake automatically handles kickstarting your efforts. Creating a private; powerful data lake is perfect for those wanting to get exposure to this type of approach without dealing with technical complexities of architecture; design; systems operations; and infrastructure. Our service optimizes and automates the configuration; processing; and loading of data to your private Amazon data lake. Not only do you get the benefits of Amazon S3 and Athena; but a fully automated; efficient; and optimized data pipelines: Automatic partitioning of data — With data partitioning; we optimize the amount of data scanned by each query; thus improving performance and reducing the cost of data stored in S3 as you run queries Automatic conversion to Apache Parquet — We convert data into an efficient and optimized open-source columnar format; Apache Parquet. This lowers costs when you execute queries as the Parquet files columnar format are highly optimized for interactive query services like Athena Automatic data compression — With data in Apache Parquet compression is performed column by column using Snappy; which means not only supports query optimizations; it reduces the size of the data stored in your Amazon S3 bucket which reduces costs Automated database and table creation — As upstream data changes; we automatically version tables and views. Data is analyzed and the system “trained” to infer schemas to automate the creation of database; views; and tables in the Athena No coding required — Using the Openbridge web interface; users can create and configure an Amazon data lake using S3; IAM; and AWS Athena This means you can focus on using the data; not managing; building; and deploying infrastructure. Start Small; Build On Success We know it is not always easy to kickstart a data lake effort in a self-service world. This is why we advocate the use of pre-built data lakes for pilots or proofs-of-concept. What better way to demonstrate how you can use a data lake than to demonstrate how it is helping your team avoid unnecessarily wasting valuable human resources like analysts; engineers or data scientists undertaking manual data wrangling efforts. We have launched a code-free; zero-admin; fully automated data pipeline that automates database; table creation; Parquet file conversion; Snappy compression; partitioning; and more. Get started with Amazon Redshift Spectrum or Amazon Athena for free! Want to discuss a solution like this for your organization? Need a platform and team of experts to kickstart your data and analytic efforts? We can help! Getting traction adopting new technologies; especially if it means your team is working in different and unfamiliar ways; can be a roadblock for success.

2019 Resolutions For Berlin’s Startup Scene,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write 2019 Resolutions For Berlin’s Startup Scene Tricia Levasseur · Follow 12 min read · Jan 2; 2019 166 1 Photo by Markus Spiske on Unsplash. 3 resolutions to kick-start 2019 in Berlin: Looking forward to 2019; here are some potential new years resolutions Berlin’s startup scene could consider for increasing the ecosystem’s success over the next year as the UK prepares to Brexit and leaves Berlin as the EU’s largest startup hub. 1. Be inspired; don’t just copy: This isn’t a new piece of constructive criticism. Berlin appears to be fond of copying. It can be pretty shameless. Some startups make no attempt to evolve beyond something that already exists. Sure; in business it’s good to benchmark your competition. But what seems to go on in a few places around Berlin isn’t benchmarking; it is straight copying. Business Insider article. I find this sad for a few reasons. Startup employees with genuine creativity who care about providing value to customers and shareholders feel like their internal flame is being slowly extinguished at a clone factory. It’s also not a good way to mentor young people just entering employment by teaching them that they shouldn’t think for themselves but instead switch-off their robust brains and just copy. What will these workers be like in 10-20 years time when they’ll most likely be needed to use their creative problem solving brains? And demonstrate true leadership skills? This just feels damaging for long-term career development. What happens when Germany’s workforce has a fat layer of mid and senior level managers who are only skilled at copying? On the other hand; buyers — including German consumers — deserve better than cheap knock-offs being pushed to try and position a startup for a quick high priced acquisition for founder paydays and investor profits. Copying will only make you as good as the one you’re copying *IF* you’re lucky. It will never make you better. And in today’s highly competitive marketplace creating a unique brand buyers fall in love with is necessary for long term success. I also wonder how Berlin will manage to outmanouver the largest startup hub in Europe; London; if it’s main startup driver happens to be cloned companies? London’s having a bit of a moment with Brexit; but people don’t actively sit around thinking about existing businesses they can copy and roll-out for fast money. But this absolutely happens in Berlin. All. The. Time. Further; here’s a U.S.example. Think about Facebook. It was not the first social network. MySpace and LinkedIn were already operational. However; Mark Zuckerberg didn’t sit around in his dorm at Harvard wondering how to clone MySpace. Instead he was inspired by the other nextworks and created something new with clear differentiating factors that people could really fall in love with. Since Facebook was different enough to become original — people did fall in love with it — and Facebook was able to scale globally. Copying what everyone else is doing also isn’t a long-term strategy for growing a sustainable economy. If all you want to do is create clones and sell into foreign companies as fast as possible — that’s not really setting the German economy up to have decades of rich global businesses driving it. Germany is still lucky to have a strong automotive industry but; with the way startups in Berlin are now; I’d worry about relying on the city’s copy-cat segement of startups to be the next generation of long-term German giants. Consumers fall in love with things that are original AND original can be scaled globally. Either be completely original or be inspired. Don’t just copy. 2. Stop competing on price: This is an outdated and; in my opinion; unhelpful strategy that has roots in the City’s own marketing. Perhaps competing on price worked 15 years ago to get people back into Berlin. These days not only is it not exactly true; it sets the bar very low for the expectations of companies and founders coming to Berlin. Berlin Partner paid for article in the New York Times. Many who are enticed to come to Berlin by this marketing campaign; expect to pay the lowest price for everything including the people they hire. So; employees are faced with a rude reality when they’re offered salaries that are below the market rate. Further; if you stroll into any online expat forum; you’ll see there are always workers talking about how some jobs didn’t even pay at all. For the unlucky; they were greeted by the unofficial ‘Berlin Startup Welcome Package’ where they got hired; and then gave a big old brain-dump of intel into their new employer during the onboarding process only to be let-go just before actually reporting for their first shift. Sometimes the startup worker is cut even after having paid for their own relocation. Out of the startup employees who have paid for their own move and experience fast job loss; there’s a segement further that still never receives any conpensation for the work completed and costs incurred. Other times people struggle to get their last paycheck paid. Indeed; the word I see used most online to describe Berlin’s startup employment offering is ‘precarious’. While these shenanigans may be happening in other startup ecosystems; they simply aren’t talked about or documented at the rate that I see this happening in Berlin. Cruise into the expat forums and read for yourself. People with first-hand knowledge of the Berlin scene; regularly try to be a pal and drive newcomers to other cities in Germany where employment is more dependable. This reputation for Berlin as having ‘precarious employment’ is not good and can only be cleaned-up by following proper human resources policies and laws. For startups to be encouraged to stop exploiting talent; the City itself needs to care and actually enforce rules and regulations on the employers who are violating the norms. For that to happen; Berlin needs to stop marketing itself as the cheapest option going because people tend to not respect things when they’re operating on a race to the bottom. And Berlin isn’t cheap anymore — something that’s sparked several protests recently. For those that haven’t heard; housing is in short supply across Germany’s major cities meanwhile prices are at an all-time high. Many expats complain about the ruthlessness of house hunting. Their stories contain the same shenanigans from Berlin to Munich. “Expat forums are filled with tips; and an English-speaker advised newcomers to submit CVs; pay slips; credit histories and references to potential landlords. Apartment hunters often wind up starting jobs while they urgently hunt for a home in the evenings. They sleep on friends’ couches; mull bribes and swap stories of scams.” — Allision Williams; Handlesblatt Global It’s common knowledge that having people living in your city is a good thing. Workers spend their wages locally on things like rent; food; transportation; and entertainment. But it isn’t good enough to just take money from people without providing a lawful environment for them to live and work anymore. All business schools teach the dangers of competing on cost. Berlin is not an undesirable city trying to regenerate. It is a nation’s capital and the second largest city in Europe. And the business policy makers need to start behaving like that. 3. Make business regulations more competitive: After updating the city’s strategy to not attract business by competing as the cheapest option going; leaders need to improve business regulations to make things more accessible and inclusive. Now let’s take a step back to understand where things are today. Berlin entered the 20th century as a global powerhouse for technology and banking. For example; Siemens built and operated the first telegraph from Europe to the United States from Berlin. At the same time that Berlin was creating world changing technological innovations; the city was also home to many international banks. But then the World Wars happened and brought very dark times. Afterwards Berlin was left destroyed; de-industrialized; and divided. As a result; all the big companies and banks moved away; and new companies avoided the very complicated situation Berlin had. Even when reunification happened in 1990; Berlin had some major challenges. Officials needed to reunite a collapsed socialistic planned economy with low productivity and few competitive products on the Eastern side with a highly subsidized economy on the Western side. As a result of reunification; there was a lot of pressure to find new ways to develop and move Berlin’s unified economy forward. Business is thriving again at Berlin’s previously derelict Postdamer Platz. During the decades since reunification; Berlin’s changed. It has become one of the leading digital hotspots for Europe. It also holds a thriving entrepreneurial ecosystem. Berlin’s startup scene is the largest within the Eurozone and the second largest in the European Union only behind London. Government officials state that every 20 hours a startup is founded within its technology sector. And if the UK completes the Brexit process; Berlin will become the largest startup ecosystem within the European Union too. But all this incredible growth isn’t coming without highlighting additional challenges. With the attraction and creation of new businesses; the city’s population has grown rapidly over the last 10 years. Housing in Berlin is under pressure as already mentioned — there were no shortage of news headlines about this throughout 2018. This means politicians need to consider how to foster economic growth while continuing to provide a high quality of living. In my opinion; it also means they need to consider looking at their business registration processes and employment regulation. In Germany the main company form that startups choose is also the most widespread type of company formation in Germany; the Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung or “GmbH”; which translated literally; means a ‘company with limited liability’. For comparision; in the UK the main company form startups tend to choose is the LTD or limited liability company. As far as European businesses go; both the Germany GmbH and the UK LTD (registered in England and Wales) offer strong international confidence due to the high operational standards applied by the German and British regulators and the established legal framework in both Germany and England. However; while in Germany having limited liability is ideal for entrepreneurs who want to protect their private assets while projecting a public image of legitimacy to their customers and business partners; the GmbH often presents challenges for founders that ultimately make it less attractive than some other country’s limited liability formations. German GmbH Challenges: High fees for entry in the commercial register (Handelsregister) High investment costs: a minimum capital of €25;000 must be available; and at least half of this must be available in the business account at the time of entry into the Handelsregister High secondary costs: Consultancy fees for lawyers and tax advisers can cost up to €2;000 Restrictions on one-person-GmbHs to create capital in the form of contributions in kind; which place a high financial burden on the individual In cases of bankruptcy (Insolvenz): Missing capital contributions must be offset by private assets; this becomes especially burdensome for one-person-GmbHs While some might be thinking “this is great; I know any German company I’m doing business with has a solid foundation!” there are other areas that are holding German GmbHs back. At the recently held TechCrunch Disrupt Berlin; I attended a panel discussion that addressed fundraising for German startups. One of the biggest hurdles identified was the fact it is so unattractive to issue employee shares from a GmbH. It was felt by panellists that this needed to be addressed by authorities as a matter of urgency to make German businesses even more competitive. According to the hosts of the session I attended; the law firm Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer LLP; “employee share plans [in Germany] incentivize; motivate and retain management board members and executive employees; and consequently increase the company’s productivity; but are also seen as a capital investment tool in the current low-interest phase. Compared to other European countries; the total number of participants in employee share plan participants in Germany is relatively small. One key reason is that employee share plans do not provide significant tax benefits under German tax laws (for example; in comparison to Austrian or UK laws).” When a startup issues shares in a German GmbH; employee plans can offer both shares and other forms of long-term incentives to provide a mixture of cash and equity-related instruments. Typically; shares are most likely to be offered once a startup has received venture capital funding and the VC helps oversee the development of an employee share plan. However; the major downside for executive level-employees in accepting a job where much of the salary is in share options is that there is no specific tax relief for employees regarding share option plans in Germany. This really needs to be revisited by lawmakers because it is a huge hurdle for startups to offer and get employees onto a share plan and there’s a lot of research that shows its good for everyone when employees own a stake in their employer’s company. It also helps startups distribute costs during those critical early years when the finance team prefers to invest cash back into the business to help make it grow. And finally; it is legal for GbmH’s to offer shares conditionally — meaning they are only exercisable if an employee hits performance targets or time-based vested conditions are met. The debate at Techcrunch Disrupt Berlin had two main complaints: For startups that have not proven they can survive yet while offering largely equity-based salaries; employees said they viewed this as too much risk to accept. Employees weren’t interested in an equity based package because it wasn’t clear if the delayed gratification would pay off. At the same time; if they did manage to make money from shares; the tax rate for GmbH employees was so high that any share amount would have to be large for any serious amount of money to be made for all the hard work completed while deferring total compensation for many years. Startup owners complained employees in Berlin just want cash without equity. Some said they try to offer plans; but employees refuse them because the regulations surrounding them are so unattractive (especially in comparison to the US; UK; and Canada). Let’s take a closer look at GmbH Share Options Plan particulars: For clarity; the law firm Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer LLP explains; “the benefit derived from the exercise of share options is generally subject to income taxes and taxed as employment income. The taxable benefit is also subject to a solidarity surcharge and to church tax (if applicable). The taxable benefit is the difference between the exercise price and the fair market value of the shares at the date of exercise (that is; the date when the shares are recorded in the employee’s account). The benefit is added to the employee’s taxable income and subject to the employee’s individual progressive income tax rate. The highest marginal income tax rate in 2017 is 45%; plus a 5.5% solidarity surcharge levied on the income tax. The church tax rate (if applicable) depends on the religious community and the federal state to which the employee belongs. The taxable benefit is also subject to social security contributions (different rates apply to pension; unemployment and healthcare insurance). Social security contributions are; however; capped; so that no additional contributions are levied if the total employment income exceeds a certain level per year. The employer and the employee are each liable for half of the contributions.” Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer LLP further details regulations for employees selling their shares; “on the disposal of shares acquired on exercise of an option; the capital gain is subject to (privileged) capital gains tax at a flat rate of 25% (plus a 5.5% solidarity surcharge and church tax; if any) provided that the shares were placed in the employee’s account after 31 December 2008. If the shares comprise 1% or more of the company’s total share capital; the employee’s individual income tax rate applies. In this case; 40% of the capital gains are tax-exempt. The taxable capital gain is the difference between the acquisition cost (that is; the fair market value of the shares at the date of exercise) and the sale price. If the capital gain from the disposal of shares is paid out or credited by a German financial services institution (or an equivalent institution); withholding taxes must generally be deducted by that institution and paid to the tax authorities. Generally; the tax deduction is final (Abgeltungsteuer). However; on application by the employee; the individual income tax rate can be applied if it is more beneficial to the employee. If no German financial services institution is involved; the employee must declare the capital gain in his or her personal annual income tax return.” There’s no question that Berlin is a dynamic and vibrant city. The quality of life is good compared to many other cities of its size. But if Berlin’s startup ecosystem wants to really soar in 2019; adjusting its attitude towards copying other businesses; not competing as the cheapest option going; and making its regulatory approach to issuing employee shares more competitive will help the city’s startups achieve even greater success.

The VC-Backed Startup Solving Education,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write The VC-Backed Startup Solving Education Miruna Girtu · Follow Published in The Startup · 6 min read · Jan 2; 2019 90 The challenge of education is complex. How can the knowledge and skills of an expert be deconstructed into a format that can be understood by a novice; and then built up in a way that transforms the novice into an expert? How to ensure genuine retained understanding; memory; ability and transferrable intelligence? And how to do it at scale? “This is only possible by combining effective instruction (teaching); cognitive science and neuroscience; and technology (artificial intelligence) — in one solution;” summarizes Guy Riese; Forbes 30 under 30; CEO and CoFounder of Up Learn. “If you take just one of those you can have a good product. If you take two; it can be great. If you take all three and do it right; you solve education.” It all started when Riese fell ill at the beginning of his A Levels and missed an entire term. Keen not to move down a year; he searched the internet for ways to catch up and came across research on effective learning in the field of cognitive science. He applied these insights to his studies and rose from below average grades to top of his year in Maths; Chemistry; and Physics. He went on to achieve straight A*s; scoring 100% in Physics and secured a place at Imperial College London to study Mechanical Engineering. Riese then graduated with 1st Class Honours and a dissertation on Machine Learning. “The secret to my success; and why some students get A*s; whilst others get Cs and Ds; has not been because of what I’ve learnt; it’s been how.” I founded Up Learn to create a system for making the most effective learning experience in the world accessible to all”. Optimised learning; powered by AI and cognitive science Up Learn is building a product that delivers education success at scale; starting with A Levels. It consolidates thousands of learning resources in one system. The content created by Up Learn teachers is fuelled by research into cognitive science; which ensures its efficiency and efficacy. As a student starts going through the content; Up Learn’s AI continuously analyses their strengths; weaknesses; and behaviour at a granular level; and uses the insights to direct them to the most important lesson; quiz or activity for them to do next; until they reach 90% in every topic. Throughout the process; students have access to live on-demand tutoring and to videos that simulate real-life lessons. To support the latter; Up Learn has built its own animation capability that produces high-quality videos at low cost and is open for other businesses to use. Guaranteed results or money back Over the past two years; 97% of the students who completed Up Learn courses have achieved A*–A grades. Confident in the effectiveness of its proprietary approach; Up Learn guarantees that its students will achieve an A-A* grade upon completion of its online course; or their money back — a potentially risky decision for a business that caters to thousands of different types of students. “This is a widespread misconception throughout society when thinking about intelligence and education. If I asked you; how could you possibly know that an antibiotic is going to kill bacteria in everyone? What would you say? Science. These treatments are studied against controls to determine how effective they are. And some treatments can get very close to 100%;” Riese explains. “It can work just the same for education. We use scientific methods to study the effectiveness of our education treatments. And that’s how we can get such results with certainty and guarantee outcomes at scale.” Fighting inequality The uncomfortable truth is that; according to an Annual Report published by the Education Policy Institute in the U.K.; by the end of primary school; children from low-income families are 9.4 months behind on average — a gap that grows to 18.4 months by the time they leave secondary education. Up Learn is not free to use — it charges per school year per subject. Riese is aware that not everyone will be able to afford it and has a solution. “Making the most effective education solution only available to those who can afford it would only worsen the existing inequality in education and further reduce social mobility. For that reason; we have set a goal — for every student who pays for Up Learn; we provide a course free to a student who can’t. We offer an unlimited number of free scholarships to students who meet one of our set criteria. Last year; about 25% of the students enrolled in Up Learn were on these scholarships — something we are very proud of.” The end of exams Up Learn’s mission is to solve education as a whole. “For example; in the future; Up Learn could deliver the entire curriculum learning and assessment component of education. It’s unnecessary for students to sit the actual exam — we have already determined their grade. Students currently might take a two-hour exam; once a year. Instead; we collect over a hundred hours of learning and assessment data; continuously. Once the student reaches A* level; we could; in theory; issue their grade. Without an exam and without any stress. It becomes about completing the learning — actually having the knowledge and skills — instead of how you perform on a specific day with specific questions. ” Investing in education Reflecting both the existing challenges and the opportunities in the EdTech space; investment activity is at an all-time high; with international funding reaching a new record of $10.58 Billion in investment in the first three quarters of 2018. The EdTech market is projected to grow at 17.0% per annum; to $252 Billion by 2020. Riese started the company with personal funds; selling his first company when still at university; along with a Young Innovators award from CVC Capital Partners. It was then bootstrapped from there to first revenue. Up Learn has since raised over $3 Million in seed funding; investors including Forward Partners; SyndicateRoom’s Growth Fund and a number of high profile private investors. Luke Smith; Investor at Forward Partners comments “In a world where the majority of new jobs being created require high skill levels; education is increasingly important in our shared success. And as a parent of young children; I’ve experienced the appetite to invest in my children’s future first hand. But tech’s impact on education has been more limited than you might expect. Over the past few years; the use of AI and technologies like personalised learning have received a lot of attention (and VC funding) but adoption has been slow. Equally; many of these businesses have struggled to gain momentum due to long; careful sales cycles from the educational institutions. Against this background; we’re delighted to reveal our investment in a company that we think will transform education by avoiding some of these pitfalls; and quickly bring better educational outcomes to the masses.” Read more about Forward’s investment into Up Learn here. The typical strategy in education is focusing on just one specific component. Under this scenario; Riese believes that solving education would only be possible if every company and organisation solving the individual components collaborated and connected with an unprecedented level of transparency and perfect cohesion. He sees that as an unlikely outcome. “The only way to tackle the entire challenge of education is by doing a number of different things — all the components of it — and doing them really well. This is hard; but ultimately the most valuable problem to be solving.” This ambitious goal can still be highly focused. “We’re not trying to build 100 different features; we’re trying to build the one feature that solves 100 different problems.” Up Learn is driven by a belief that a complete and effective solution will lead to a future where every motivated student succeeds; qualifications are earned in less time and people are better equipped to contribute to a growing economy.

All Tech Projects run over budget; change our mind.,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write All Tech Projects run over budget; change our mind. Why you should triple your budget Wendy Dean · Follow Published in pushtostart · 5 min read · Jan 2; 2019 760 2 When I first started out in the tech industry; my first boss gave me a nice tip. “Whatever they quote you… triple it.” At the time I thought he was insane. Triple it?! Sure I knew that sometimes projects run a little over budget; but triple? I was young; incredulous; and naive — in my own arrogance; I ignored his advice. Two months later; I was sitting across from him in our executive conference room. Had I experienced insane success and been promoted to an executive position; all in 2 months? Advice? Who needs it No; I had horribly failed as the project I was working on ran more than 3 times over the budget; with no end in sight. I was thankful to still have my job; and passing off the project to my boss so he could cover our losses. At the time; I learned two lessons. First; that I should take advice from industry veterans. And second; that all tech projects run over budget. Why do they run over budget? In my experience there are usually three core reasons why projects run over budget: feasibility; failure to account for issues related to development; and technical debt. Feasibility This is the issue most often plaguing software development. It starts the same everytime — you meet with other members; they quote you the time and cost they think it will take to finish it. The main issue here is that; usually; they quote based on how fast the project would go without being bogged down by reviews; changes; and technical debt (more on this later). To make things worse; you’ll then go to management; who will halve all estimates. You’ll argue that this much isn’t feasible; but they’ll say some buzzwords (most notably “agile” and “sprint”) and shoo you out. Then you meet with marketing; which was supposed to meet with the software engineers last week but didn’t. They’ll ask a bunch of conceptual questions that border on philosophical — “not what is the product; why is the product?” — and you walk out a little confused; but confident in branding. But tonight one of them will have an amazing new; innovative idea for how to position the product — and in a week they’ll be pushing something that isn’t even on the roadmap. The Client Another obvious issue lies in accounting for issues related to development; especially unseen ones. How do you account for the unforeseeable? As a rule of thumb; every time you think something might go wrong; assume it will. In software; something will ALWAYS go wrong. My developers have a running joke with a calendar on the wall: “days since bug.” That number never has and never will exceed 0. The customer is always…. wrong? And then of course; there’s the client. The client comes to you with an idea — they know what they want and need you to make it. For those of you industry veterans that just did a double take on that last line; don’t worry; I was just kidding! The client absolutely doesn’t know what they want. There will be a dozen changes to the spec; several pivots and new features; and complaints when you build what they asked for but it doesn’t look as good in real life as it did in their head. Technical Debt And then there’s technical debt. What is Technical Debt and what forms does it take? Well; in general; Technical Debt arises from rushed projects and issues related to development. According to Techopedia: Technical debt is a concept in programming that reflects the extra development work that arises when code that is easy to implement in the short run is used instead of applying the best overall solution. For all you software devs; this will sound very familiar. It’s the cost that arises from when you run npm install xyz and the developer behind it stops updating xyz. It’s the cost that arises when you write that one-liner at 4pm on a Friday and knock the ball out of the park; but it starts slowing down the app and increasing server load above 10 users. For more on Technical Debt; there’s a nice piece by Tomer Dicturel explaining where we are and where we’re going that has been trending for the past few weeks on Medium: AI: the silver bullet to stop Technical Debt from sucking you dry You’ve heard a lot about student debt; but what about technical debt? towardsdatascience.com What can we do to stop them from running over budget? This is more of an open-ended question. Every project is different and; to some extent; requires its own special solution. In general though; I’ve found that properly allocating a budget that takes into account failure will save you hundreds of thousands of dollars down the road in frantic panic. Next time you get quoted $8000 and 7 days to build your app; stop and think: is this an accurate estimate? Rome wasn’t built in a day; nor was it built in a week for a couple grand — your app will most likely cost multiples of that quote; and you should expect that. We found that most projects quoted at lower estimates (usually by freelancers) run over budget and never get completed — that’s an 88% non-completion rate. So we collected more data — data on successful projects; that were completed and reached some level of success. We found that most projects hit a cost (not a budget — we took into account the final cost) between $160k and $180k. So we built a tool. At first thought this may seem insanely high; but these are the costs associated with developing long-term; sustainable tech. To make your life a little easier; we built out a calculator too — one that’ll properly budget your app for success.

What 2018 Taught Us About Everything Human,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write Member-only story What 2018 Taught Us About Everything Human The year brought a host of events; discoveries; studies; and writings that shed new light on humanity SAPIENS · Follow Published in SAPIENS · 9 min read · Jan 2; 2019 -- 1 In the fall of 2018; thousands of migrants; mainly from Central America; approached the U.S.-Mexico border; hoping for an opportunity to seek asylum in the U.S. Here; a Guatemalan woman rests at a U.S. border fence. Photo: Atilgan Ozdil/Getty Images By SAPIENS Staff T hroughout 2018; anthropologists have contributed to the world’s knowledge by exploring ancient caves and firepits to reveal clues about our deep history and evolution; journeying into obscure corners of the planet to study modern cultures; and analyzing the chemical makeup of our bones and the nature of human consciousness — just to name a few examples. More than this; anthropologists have done the much-needed work of exploring the complexities around climate change; gender struggles; gun violence; migration; genetics and race; and the rise of authoritarian governments. Here; SAPIENS takes a look at some of the major contributions of the field this year; from the current events that anthropologists have helped us understand more fully to the discoveries that brought new insights into what it means to be human. First Ancient-Human Hybrid Identified Researchers work in Denisova Cave in Russia; where the remains of an ancient-human hybrid were found. Photo: Bence Viola/Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology Paleogeneticists made headlines around the world when they reported the stunning find of a first-generation cross between two distinct human groups this August. The team’s analysis of a 90;000-year-old female bone from a Siberian cave showed that the individual’s mother was a Neanderthal and her father was a Denisovan (two extinct lineages of humanity). The researchers nicknamed her “Denny.” Thanks to the study of old bones and modern genomes; scientists already knew that different human groups met and mated throughout history. (Consumers can even pay to find out what percentage of their genome might be Neanderthal or Denisovan.) But finding a distinct first-generation hybrid was unprecedented and a welcome reminder of humanity’s ongoing tendency to meet; mingle; and meld rather than to live in distinct; isolated populations.

Lessons From the Immigrant Hustle: Martin Basiri,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write Lessons From the Immigrant Hustle: Martin Basiri Amine Rahal · Follow 4 min read · Jan 2; 2019 -- What’s your name; company name; and title? Martin Basiri; ApplyBoard; Co-founder and CEO. Which country did you emigrate from? I came to the U.S. from Iran. Why did you or your family decide to immigrate? I decided to immigrate primarily because I was seeking a better higher education; and Canada and the U.S. is known to have some of the best schools in the world. In addition to education; like many; I chose to immigrate because I wanted to explore opportunities; to unleash my potential where it counts. What was the most difficult thing you faced when you arrived in the US? As an immigrant; there are many challenges you face. Paperwork processes were one of them; as it was hard to understand what needed to get done and when. However; the number one challenge I faced when I arrived in the U.S. was language. The ability to communicate in words and understand gestures used in daily conversations — you can’t just translate words directly. There’s more to it. All countries have slang and that’s not just something you learn in class or through a podcast. It’s something you learn when engaging with locals. To add to this; understanding the thought process behind the language and gestures; the psychology. Why people say certain things; what people want to hear; etc. Why did you choose to become an entrepreneur? (c.f. What triggered you?). Becoming an entrepreneur wasn’t my first thought; nor was it my second or third. I just always had a passion for building things. Since early childhood; I was building things. I always wanted to be in a competitive space and to do something that challenged me and allowed me to further develop my skills. The harder the task was; the more exciting it became to me. Having said that; I became an entrepreneur as a result of my personal experiences. When I set out to study abroad and immigrate to another country; I faced a long list of obstacles. From obtaining the right information about schools and programs to applying for a visa; it was hard. Through this experience; I recognized there is a huge lack of product and software services in this particular area (EdTech). I took it upon myself to launch something; a technical solution to the problem — To challenge myself. How did you raise the money necessary to launch your business? (e.g. Did you find an investor? Did you borrow from the bank? Did you save money by working a 9 to 5? Please tell us your story.). It was an exciting challenge; trying to raise the funds needed to launch our business. It really was a trial and error; a big learning experience for us as it was all new to us. While overall it began with me saving some money working full-time; I would say the real fun began when we started asking many different people and organizations to support our idea... At the start; we received a lot of negative responses. However; we were persistent. We learned how to create a proper pitch; how to speak the language; and through this; we were able to connect with investors and certain organizations who saw potential in our business idea and wanted to support it. What was the most difficult thing you faced when you first started your business? The most difficult thing we faced was building the company revenue to a million dollars; and that challenge ultimately began with determining how exactly we needed to build the infrastructure of the company altogether. How to make a product that makes money; while still figuring out what the product was exactly; who the market is; the structure; finances; etc. It took a long time to sort through all of this; and while we face daily challenges that make running this company an incredible experience with unique days; I’m always learning and so is my team. What advice do you have for newly arrived immigrants that want to pursue the path of entrepreneurship? When you decide to move to a new country; you are given the gift of a blank slate. Take advantage of this incredible opportunity and become who you want to be and may have been afraid to be back home. Don’t be afraid of the challenges. Instead; be open and adaptive. Step outside of your comfort zone and get to know the local community instead of seeking a piece of home. This is the only way you’ll get familiar with local norms. Don’t be afraid to take risks or to fail; embrace what’s to come as it’s the only way you’ll learn. You’ll figure it out as you go; you’ll see what practices you can use from home and what practices you can adopt in the U.S. Finally; be positive. Don’t fixate on the things back home and do a compare and contrast on both countries. You left for a reason; so do what you came here to do. Pursue your dreams; accept the changes and adapt to them. Remember; some of the biggest and best companies in the world were launched by first or second-generation immigrants. You could be next.

Haulio: The Future of Haulage is here (Part 1),Open in app Sign up Sign in Write Haulio: The Future of Haulage is here (Part 1) Alvin Ea · Follow 5 min read · Jan 2; 2019 54 Impossible is for the weak. A Series of Crazy Decisions 6 years ago; I made a crazy decision to join my Dad and was since thrusted into this vaguely familiar industry of transporting goods. As a kid; I spent my school holidays tagging my “uncles” who drove me around; making deliveries to hotel chains; supermarkets and warehouses. As the new “ah sia kia” (rich guy son) or “towkay kia” (boss’ son) in the office; one of my biggest challenge was to work with the same “uncles” who watched me grew up. Father-Son Combo What really amazed me when I first plunged into this Supply Chain industry full-time was literally the tonnes of problems I had to solve. I mean; how hard could it be to move goods from one point to another; right? WRONG! I was fascinated by the complexity behind; yet at many times; simply couldn’t understand many of the “hard rules” that people just follow blindly and comply to. Why can’t we do things in another way that can possibly save us more time and efforts? My very First Prime Mover in 2013 In 2013; I made my 2nd crazy decision to start a Container Haulage business; after my first year in the family business. It was (and still is) very common to get this: “Just follow my way of doing things; when Uncle was doing this; you were still drinking milk.” How best to move away from that than getting into an entirely new business unit that even my Dad is not familiar with? Being young and ambitious; I thought; “How hard can it be to move Containers right?” WRONG AGAIN! I finally understood why my previous contractors were always failing me; why containers are always “On The Way” or that somehow their trucks were either always having a “technical breakdown” or “tyre pangcek” (punctured). It was a challenging job with customers not being able to understand the pains behind your operational incapability. “Don’t make your problem my problem. I pay you to solve my problems; not give me more problems.” It was indeed a problematic headache. Despite that; I soldiered on alone; got my hands dirty; spent many sleepless nights alone in my office figuring out how to resolve the countless operational issues with the limited network that I had. I built and scaled the business to a sizeable fleet of 15 trucks within 3 years; and in 2016; I thought I managed to resolve the problem. Not enough truck to service customers;? Just buy more! Invest more! Soon; I began to realize that the larger my business grew; the more problems I had. Every single day; due to limiting capacity and fluctuating demands; I was choosing who to say sorry to. How can I make every customer happy when I only had 15 trucks but I have 25 customers wanting their containers first thing in the morning? With my team in 2016 Over those 5 years of toiling in the traditional logistics industry; I understood the importance of technology and observed the likes of the eCommerce companies changing the entire landscape with ridiculous speed. While the growth of my business was something to be proud of; I was missing out on something special. I was tired of trying to make a change to solve my own company’s daily struggles; when in actual fact; these problems resonate with the rest of my other “friendly competitors”. So in CNY of 2017; I made another crazy decision when I met my current Co-Founder; Sebastian Shen. It was almost as though he was sent into my life by the angels. I barely knew this guy back then; but we both had the same grand ambition — to change this traditional industry through Technology. On the 30th of March 2017; I was a Co-Founder of a Startup. It turned out to be one of the craziest; yet best decision I have made. We named it: Haulio: Haulage in Overdrive. Over the rest of 2017; we forge ahead to validate our purpose. Can such a traditional space be open to technology? Will the drivers and controllers be willing to put down their pens and papers (finally) to use our system? Will customers want to book a Container Haulage service via a platform when they have already built such strong personal relationship with their truckers over the years? We had many doubts; many questions that challenged our faith in what we both believe in; the Future of Haulage will be one that is driven by Technology. “Uncle thought of this idea 10 years ago la. Young guy; don’t try. Whatever you guys want to do; cannot one la.” The 2 Mad Guys of Haulio; Sebastian Shen (L) & Me (R) But we pushed on. The beauty of the marketplace we built came from my experience in the past; when I had to find “friendly competitors” to help with my capacity constraints. With Haulio; we have a plan to help facilitate Job-sharing via our platform across the country. After a successful incubation with PSA unboXed (PSA International’s Corporate Venture Capital arm); we introduced the first of its kind; “on-demand” Inter-Terminal Haulage (ITH) jobs (within PSA Port) to the market; instead of the old ways of supplying a fixed number of trucks via a contractual model with PSA. We ended 2017 by supporting the port with close to 20;000 TEUs completed via our platform with our 50th haulier coming onboard. On the Christmas eve of 2017; I recall having a nice cosy dinner with our newly hired Head of Technology (Goh Chun Lin) & our Haulion #1 (Payne Bao) to round up the year. While taking a stroll back to our mini office to regroup for 2018; we looked up and noticed the continuous movements of the trucks along West Coast Highway; and it was so fitting that PSA is indeed a “Port that doesn’t sleep”. That was when we came to truly understand the importance of the work that we’re embarking on for this forgotten industry and its people. Goodbye 2017… Chun Lin; Payne; Myself & Sebastian: the early Fantastic 4 It was a night where we spent working alongside those drivers and port operators with a new mission formulated in our minds.

Setup Cosmos Validator Relay Network,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write Setup Cosmos Validator Relay Network Sophie Huang · Follow 7 min read · Jan 2; 2019 170 1 This is Part III of a series of posts dedicated to exploring the topic of staking and validation as Cosmos Validator. With launch of Cosmos Hub coming; we will witness the biggest adversarial BFT distributed network. Though Tendermint gives us safety; we still need to fight for liveness of network. In this article; I will talk about how to defend the liveness with relay nodes. Part I. Anti-DDoS solution for validators Part II. Key Management System for validators Current Status of Cosmos Testnet The first adversarial testnet of Cosmos; aka Game of Stakes has just started a few days ago. It was the largest BFT network ever existed with 200+ validators securing the consensus of network. As a permissionless public blockchain; we see validators come from all over the world. According to some network traffic analysis within validator community; we see an imbalance data outbounded from different cloud server providers. A majority of data come from USA ; then Europe and Asia counts for less than 10%. My guess is price difference leads to this location clustering. Since Cosmos-SDK is based on Tendermint and we need to collect 2/3+ signatures from all the validators; this kind of geo distribution gives some validators inadvantage. Credit to @Leopold Schabel To become a well connected network world wide; more work needs to be done. And today I’d like to promote the idea of relay network. Why do we need a Relay Node Network? There are already some discussions about what a validator operator should do to build a reliable infrastructure. The sentry node solution is to make validator node resilient to DDoS attack; which is the most common attack factor in Comsos network. The discussion about sentry node leads to the idea of relay-node. According to Zaki; A Relay Node is a full node that only make persistent connections to white list IP of sentry nodes of other validators. It runs with pex disabled and . The firewall on the Relay node blocks all connections from ip address other than what is on a white list. The sentry node architecture will make each validator node strong; while relay node network will establish private connections between several validators’s sentry nodes. And relay nodes will consume less resources than public sentries. The logical layout is illustrated below: Relay node architecture In this relay node network; there are two validator nodes: A and B. The trusted links are established between relay node of A and B. In this way; even when public sentries of B are totally not working; B’s prevote & precommit message could still be gossiped to the whole network though B’s public sentry could be attacked or connected with unreliable peers. In the future; we should be able to see several relay node clusters: Asian cluster; European cluster and American cluster. Every validator won't have to have a public sentry in every cluster. He only need to make sure his relay node is well connected to join a joint VPN network. Traffic will be reduced due to fixed connections and less resourced required. P2P messages from Tendermint will still be gossiped around the world and reach consensus. How to setup a Relay Network? P2P VPN solutions A virtual private network establishes a secure private network across a public network. The key to build a relay network is to have a VPN connection. Most traditional VPN solutions follow the client-server principle; which means that all participating nodes connect to a central server. This creates a star topology; which leads to single point failure. A virtual network built by P2P VPN uses a full mesh topology. All nodes talk directly to each other; there is no need for a central server. If one node goes down; the rest of the network is unaffected. Next; I will talk about how to setup relay node network with the help of 2 popular P2P VPN solution. Tinc Tinc is a Virtual Private Network daemon that uses tunneling and optional encryption to create a secure private network between hosts on the Internet. Tinc is free open source software. Since this VPN works at the IP level network (layer 3) as a normal network device; there is no need to adapt existing software. This allows VPN sites to share and send information with each other over the public Internet on a secure way without exposing the information to others. Features of Tinc are: Minimum adaption for existing software Encryption; authentication and compression Automatic mesh routing and fully decentralized management. Easily expandable VPN Runs on many operating systems and supports IPv6. The key advantage of using tinc is that it’ll automatically configure all your nodes as soon as you connect a new one; effectively creating a mesh network of VPN endpoints. This also means that if one of the nodes fails; your remaining nodes in the mesh should continue to function without any issues. How to Install Two node Tinc VPN To set up a two-node VPN with Tinc; you need to install tinc on each server. Both of these machines are connected to the internet and are able to reach eachother. Install Tinc sudo apt-get install tinc 2. Create config files /etc/tinc/relaynet/tinc.conf for Tinc on relay1: Name = relay1 Device = /dev/net/tun AddressFamily = ipv4 Name - This is a daemon-specific name within the VPN. It should be unique. Device - Determines the virtual network to use. Tinc will automatically detect what kind of device you are using. AddressFamily - Tell tinc which type of address to use. Now you need to generate the relay2’s configuration file /etc/tinc/relaynet/tinc.conf in similar way: Name = relay2  Device = /dev/net/tun  AddressFamily = ipv4  ConnectTo = relay1 ConnectTo - This value points to the tinc daemon you want to connect. 3. Create the hosts configuration file. Because tinc is built using a peer-to-peer model each node needs to communicate with the others. The basic host file for the application server is: /etc/tinc/relaynet/hosts/relay1 Address = public-ip-node-1 Subnet = 10.0.8.1 Similarly; create a host file for the second relay node:/etc/tinc/linodeVPN/hosts/relay2 Address = public-ip-node-2  Subnet = 10.0.8.2 4. Add the public key of each node. tinc can create the key pair using the following command: sudo tincd -n linodeVPN -K 4096 This creates the private key (/etc/tinc/relaynet/rsa_key.priv) and appends the public key to the ams hosts configuration file that we recently created (/etc/tinc/relaynet/hosts/relay1 ). 5. Create VPN Control Scripts Control scripts are responsible for setting up virtual interfaces on each server. They’re needed on both servers. From the application server; create the following file to enable the tinc interface: /etc/tinc/relaynet/tinc-up #!/bin/sh  ip link set $INTERFACE up  ip addr add 192.168.100.209 dev $INTERFACE  ip route add 192.168.100.0/24 dev $INTERFACE Create a script to disable the interface:/etc/tinc/linodeVPN/tinc-down #!/bin/sh  ip route del 192.168.100.0/24 dev $INTERFACE  ip addr del 192.168.100.209 dev $INTERFACE  ip link set $INTERFACE down Create a similar set of scripts on second relay node. After creating the control scripts; you will need to change the permissions on both servers: 6. Test tinc Start the tincd daemon on the first relay node: sudo tincd -n relaynet -D -d3 Do the same on second relay node: If everything was configured successfully; you should see an output similar to this: Then you could a quick test with ping between two relay nodes using its VPN address. Great! Now you could use VPN addresses for connecting relay nodes. PeerVPN PeerVPN is a software that builds virtual ethernet networks between multiple computers. Such a virtual network can be useful to facilitate direct communication that applications like file sharing or gaming may need. Often; such direct communication is made impossible or very difficult by firewalls or NAT devices. Features of PeerVPN are: Ethernet tunneling support using TAP devices. IPv6 support. Full mesh network topology. No NAT reconfiguration necessary; only one node with a public address is required. Shared key encryption and authentication support. How to Install Download the binary files to your servers from here Create peervpn.conf for each node. port 7000 networkname RelayNet psk yoursecretpassword enabletunneling yes interface peervpn0 ifconfig4 10.0.0.1/24 This will open UDP port 7000 and create a virtual ethernet interface with the name peervpn0 and the IP address 10.0.0.1. 3. Test Similar to tinc to test if everything works; start PeerVPN on both nodes. Each node should now have created its own peervpn0 interface. It may take some time until the VPN tunnel is built. Try to ping 10.0.0.2 from one node or ping 10.0.0.1 from another. If you get a response; the VPN has been set up successfully! In Close In this article; I explained two ways to build a P2P VPN network for Cosmos validators. Relay nodes will play a key part in establishing a world-wide validator network. I wish to see more implementation of P2P VPN network in testnet.

Add Motorized Volume Control to Your Stereo with an Arduino,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write Add Motorized Volume Control to Your Stereo with an Arduino Cameron Coward · Follow 2 min read · Jan 3; 2019 42 If you lose your stereo or TV remote; it’s easy enough to setup a universal remote or even to build your own custom infrared controller. But; what if your stereo never had a remote in the first place; or it doesn’t work for your volume control setup? Plenty of vintage stereos sound great and can be found at bargain prices; but lack fancy modern conveniences like a remote control. If you find yourself with one; you can follow Redditor justikowski’s lead and add a motorized remote volume control mechanism. justikowski’s stereo is used for all of their living room audio needs; but the setup doesn’t have any remote volume control. They couldn’t just purchase a universal remote; because the stereo simply doesn’t have the capability. It might have been possible to hack the stereo itself to add that functionality; but the solution they came up with is easier — and it looks cool as heck. The solution is to set up an Arduino with an infrared receiver; and have it spin a stepper motor. A belt loops around the motor’s output and the stereo’s volume knob. The Arduino can be programmed to accept infrared commands from any button on any remote; so it’s easy to use whatever remote you already have on hand. The Arduino and motor are packed into a simple 3D-printed enclosure made from black ABS; so it blends in seamlessly with the other devices on the entertainment center.

The Road to Mass Adoption: Are Cryptocurrencies Solving Today’s Problems?,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write The Road to Mass Adoption: Are Cryptocurrencies Solving Today’s Problems? New technology can be ‘cool’; ‘interesting’ and ‘accessible’ but it doesn’t mean a market-worthy mass of people will use it Team Luno · Follow Published in Luno Publication · 6 min read · Jan 2; 2019 -- 2 Photo by Ryoji Iwata on Unsplash Many (very sound) theories out there provide promising arguments on which cryptocurrency is ‘the best’. At Luno; we believe in survival of the fittest. That is to say: the cryptocurrency which fits best with the evolving human needs of our global financial system. But a few smaller ones may stick around to meet niche needs. These snowflake altcoins are well suited to specific uses; though they’re not right for everyone. However; when we decide which cryptocurrencies to list on Luno; one of our requirements is that they have a clear potential for mass adoption and are already showing consistent; long-term market traction. Basically; we need to be sure lots of people want to use them and will keep using them. That means that altcoins we might support have to solve a real problem. What is mass adoption? It’s often said that technology adoption follows a bell curve with defined stages as different people start catching on. It usually begins with innovators: those on the cutting edge of technology who are in the know about brand new developments. They’re followed by early adopters; who tend to be young; well-educated and able to take risks before the early majority move in; think hipsters; but less concerned with the price of avo-toast and more concerned with technological advancements. Although slightly more risk-averse; these people are nonetheless open-minded and susceptible to the influence of early adopters. Next; come the more sceptical late majority; then the ‘laggards.’ By this point; mass adoption has probably been achieved within the relevant market. Source: Craig Chelius via Wikimedia Commons Mass adoption is the point where a technology is thoroughly embedded and integrated into our lives; making it almost impossible to avoid. It’s at this point where it’s ubiquitous and usually cheaply available. It’s usually at this point that the real (read: annoying) hipsters scorn said technology in favour of some long-gone nostalgia. What does it take to reach mass adoption? The entrepreneurial spirit is often about ‘scratching your own itch’ or meeting your own needs. But it’s not enough for it to solve one person’s problems. For a new technology (any technology; not just cryptocurrencies) to gain widespread adoption and market traction; it needs to have a clear and unique use-case which solves a problem for a large number of people. For example; telephones achieved mass adoption because everyone needs to communicate with each other; and they’re far more efficient than older methods like sending physical mail. Combine that need with low cost; easy-to-use technology and phones were able to take over the world. It also needs to be a pressing issue; rather than an excuse to use the Blockchain when it’s not even necessary; or people won’t be willing to adopt it widely. Humans are creatures of habit and we won’t change those habits without a strong enough incentive. Just look at our incessant need to keep watching Dwayne ‘The Rock’ Johnson movies. Unless a cryptocurrency can save a lot of time and money; or have some other tangible form of utility; people are unlikely to go to the effort of adopting it. After all; learning about a new cryptocurrency and how to use; spend; and store it; is a lot of work. Seeing as so many new altcoins are launched every single day; any particular project faces fierce competition and needs to truly stand out from the crowd to get noticed by more than a handful of people. Many altcoins are simply an excuse to benefit from the hype surrounding anything using Blockchain technology and aren’t truly needed. There’s still much to do and plenty to simplify. There’s currently one too many geeky terms being thrown around and too much emphasis on how the technology works. Granted; it is a new technology and it is important to attract brilliant minds to help build the infrastructure; but the end user doesn’t need to know about the hash rate or side chains. Take the internet for example; do you know how it works? Let’s face it: Poor usability and interfaces overwrought with intricate complexities of ‘the blockchain’ are only deterring people from adopting it. For cryptocurrencies to reach mass adoption; there are additional requirements. There needs to be easy access to objective education to help people learn about it. The price of the currency can’t be too volatile or it will be difficult for people to use it. Plus; the network itself has to scale well and handle an influx of users. More importantly; it needs to be easy to use. Community is everything Unfortunately; it looks like high school never ends. Not truly; because only the most popular altcoins are likely to flourish in their environments. It’s simply not enough to be ‘a little better’. An altcoin needs to hold relevance for a large number of people. It needs to solve a problem which doesn’t already have a working solution. And; in a glorious script-flip; Bitcoin nerds are the popular ones at Real Life High School. In this industry community is everything. Bitcoin might not be the best cryptocurrency if we look at objective measures like speed; cost; and user-friendliness. But; being the first; it has a substantial surrounding community of crypto-geeks who believe in it. That means stronger surrounding infrastructure. More awareness. More developers working to improve the software. More revisions and updates. More media coverage. More trust and stability. More motivation for regulators to take a sensible approach. More high-fives in the corridor on the way to the next class. It would take a lot for any new altcoins to usurp that advantage built up over a decade. So while we’re always open to adding new cryptocurrencies; Bitcoin arguably has the strongest shot at mass adoption. In one recent survey; 43% of people viewed Bitcoin as most likely to gain broad adoption; and 17% said the same about Ethereum. Earlier this year; Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin clarified his stance that easy access is essential for adoption; more so than other initiatives: “I think there’s too much emphasis on BTC/ETH/whatever ETFs; and not enough emphasis on making it easier for people to buy $5 to $100 in cryptocurrency via cards at corner stores. The former is better for pumping price; but the latter is much better for actual adoption.” This is a crucial point — a cryptocurrency needs to be easy to use and understand to have a shot at mass adoption. Essentially we’re not looking to be dazzled by brilliance or baffled by bull; we just want cryptocurrencies that work. ICOs (Initial Coin Offerings) are facing their moment of reckoning as the hype dies down and reality kicks in. November 2018 funding totalled just 65 million USD; compared to an average of three billion USD per month during the first quarter of 2018. At least twelve ICOs that raised over 50 million USD have yet to release anything and with a market awash in ICO tokens; they’re unlikely to meet much success if they do. Others are facing legal action for disguising securities as tokens. So it seems that most are not solving real problems. We know it might be frustrating if Luno doesn’t support your favourite altcoin; but it’s a decision we’ve made to protect our customers. Our customers rely on us to be the safest and easiest way to buy Bitcoin and Ethereum. So we don’t want to devote too many resources to projects that don’t support that goal. In addition to requiring the potential for mass adoption; any coin we list needs to be decentralised; secure; backed by a trustworthy team; and wanted by enough of our customers. Most important; it needs to align with our central vision of upgrading the world to a better financial system. We always encourage you to do your own research before you consider buying any altcoins.

How to create leadership legacy for unknown futures.,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write Member-only story How to create leadership legacy for unknown futures. Lucy Hackshaw · Follow 7 min read · Jan 2; 2019 -- 1 As our world speeds up exponentially; the urgency for leaders to prioritise innovation has never felt more real. Disruptive technologies and a fear of the unknown is making it increasingly difficult for even the most progressive leaders and their organisations; to thrive. With less and less time to think more innovatively; those expected to lead are struggling to sustain productivity; performance and relevance — both personally and collectively. A curious mindset however; offers leaders a new outlook. An optimistic one. OUR ECONOMY IN MOTION Catalysed by the rise of automation; a new economic era is emerging. In the past; we have given names to economies based on the main skills or attributes needed to sustain economic growth. For example; the Industrial Age was mainly sustained by machines and more recently the Knowledge Economy was powered by the use of human knowledge to create technology and new systems. Now with disruptive technologies on the rise; we are questioning the role of the human in the workforce; furthermore how industry will need to shift for humans to thrive in this emergent economy — the Human led Economy. The key to organisations successfully making the transition to the Human led Economy will be in how well they instil a mindset of curiosity; how well the leaders of those organisations model curiosity; and how relevant the tools are that they invest in to enable lifelong learning for their people. How industry will measure success; productivity and growth in this new age is equally fascinating. Whilst the Knowledge Economy favoured material wealth generated by collective human capital; the Human led Economy favours creativity; passion; character; and collaborative spirit. This matches with research found in a recent McKinsey study; which identifies how people of this new era will have to hone higher cognitive skills in order to generate economic growth. At the core of this shift is automation; which is changing the type of work we are expected to do. Machine learning will take over repetitive tasks; such as data entry or contract drafting; as well as solve problems that require vast amounts of data using research aggregation. This will leave more time for humans to perform higher cognitive… -- 1 Written by Lucy Hackshaw 20 Followers A seasoned entrepreneur; hungry for her next start up; Flux — where progressive leaders choose curiosity; creativity; and lasting human legacy.

Hello World,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write Hello World Brittney Ball · Follow Published in The <B> Word · 6 min read · Jan 2; 2019 -- 3 I would first like to Thank You for taking the time out to read my first “official” blog post! Since this is THE FIRST I think I should give a somewhat brief introduction on who I am; why I decided to start blogging; what you can expect from my blog; and why I chose to title my blog “The <B> Word”. I am originally from Washington D.C. (born and raised); but decided to relocate to Charlotte N.C at the beginning of 2018 to start a new life in a city that I was somewhat familiar with. I had heard that the Tech scene in Charlotte had been developing and since my contract with Georgetown University was ending soon I felt like that was the universe giving me the green light to take a chance and start over fresh. I was able to secure an apartment for my boys and I and immediately started the dreaded JOB SEARCH after. I had been meeting with different recruiting agencies; sending out hundreds of resumes; and it always ended with similar if not the same results… “ Dear Ms. Ball; we appreciate you coming in to interview with us but at this time we are looking for a candidate with a little more experience.” Can you say discouraging! I began to doubt myself and my decision to move my little family to Charlotte. One day; I decided to try a different method of getting my foot in the door of one these tech companies. I decided to research companies in Charlotte and find the top five that I would like to work for and look up developers who were already working there on LinkedIn and introduce myself that way! Hey; they say sometimes its not what you know but who you know that gets you in; and what did I have to lose? Luckily; the first developer I messaged on LinkedIn immediately responded back. He informed me that the company he worked for was currently not hiring but he recommended that I join a local meetup group called the “Charlotte Devs”. He said that they might be able to assist me on my job search. I wasted no time joining the meetup group and was added to the slack workspace. I introduced myself right away and shared how the interview process had lowered my confidence and how I really just wanted to find a great company that saw my potential and would be willing to invest in my growth. Moments later I received a private message that reassured me that Charlotte was where I belonged. “ Would you be interested in interviewing for a position here at SKOOKUM?” Ummm; YES PLEASE!!! By this time I had heard amazing stories about the Skookum culture and how it was voted one of the number one places to work in Charlotte. I was soo excited! Ok; let’s fast forward 6 months into my internship at Skookum; which was originally suppose to only be a 6 week contract role (big smile)! At this point I’m full of nerves because the internship is almost over and I didn’t know whether or not I was going to have a job offer in the end. I couldn’t sleep. Anxiety started to set in. I turned to twitter for motivation and to reassure me that “I’VE GOT THIS”. As I sat in bed reading everyones testimonies about how coding had changed their lives I decided to post a tweet to remind myself of how far I’ve came and to let others know that with determination and desperation you can change your situation. I woke up the next morning and my tweet have went viral! I was amazed that what had seemed like such a simple tweet to me resonated with soo many people. This was thousands of strangers telling me how proud they were of me; that they were rooting for me; and had NEVER met me in person. My day had been made.. or so I thought. I went in to work and shared what had happened with a few of my coworkers who were just as excited and shocked as I was. By the end of the day I received the message I had been anticipating…a slack message from the Engineering Director asking to meet with me. I instantly thought “aww man let me find a box to toss my stuff in” LOL. I can’t remember how long we talked honestly because I was soo nervous that it seemed like everything was moving in slow motion and then I heard it… we would like to keep you on FULL-TIME as a Software Engineer!! Tears of joy burned my face because even though my learning journey wasn’t over I had finally found a company that believed in me and wanted to help me grow! A viral tweet and I was brought on full-time that same day!! November 28th was honestly the best day for me in 2018. Since I was now officially a Skookum employee I had decided to share my story with my coworkers since the tweet sparked some curiosity and they were already aware that I had taken a non-traditional route into tech (Self Taught). After hearing my story I was asked if it would be ok to publish my story on the Skookum blog and of course I said “YES”. Since then the article and my tweet have been shared all over the different social media platforms; it’s been featured in different tech newsletters; and shared on other websites. You can read the article HERE. Which brings me to why I decided to start a blog. It wasn’t because I’m a millennial and almost every millennial wants to be a successful blogger LOL. It was because I feel like I have something important to share with others. I want to show people what my journey through tech looks like as a working SINGLE mother; as a minority; and as a woman who happens to be self taught without a college degree. I want to continue to inspire those that may think that they can not succeed by sharing my truths no matter how ugly. I want to show people tech through my eyes. As I learn I will share my methods of learning; the difficulty level; and what I struggled with. I also want to give my thoughts on important nontechnical issues that matter such as diversity and inclusion in tech that often gets swept under the “rug”. Majority of the time when I read tech blogs and feel intimidated because the authors seem so senior and robotic. I can’t relate or really follow what they are trying to teach because it doesn’t seem like they are writing for the newbies. That’s where I plan on picking up the slack (ha ha). My plan is to make this blog the “watering hole” for developers of all skill levels. And now i’ll explain the why I chose to title my blog “The <B> Word”…. It honestly took me two weeks to find a name I liked that correlated with my blogs purpose. It had to be edgy; punny; and simple. After being smothered in brain fog I decided to use one of those name generating websites LOL. The first name that came up was The B Word. I thought “hmm I like it” but how can I incorporate tech? Presto!!! I turned the B into the <B> tag!! Which gave the title soo much more meaning!! I knew that seeing the title peoples immediate thought would shift to the profane word most commonly used to degrade women; and I wanted to challenge that way of thinking by adding a positive twist. The <B> is bold; strong; and demands attention and that’s EVERYTHING I want this blog to be. So there you have it! A brief introduction of what you can expect from my blog in 2019! I hope I piqued your interest and you continue to come back. Thank you for being apart of this journey with me and HAPPY NEW YEAR!

How to Track and Improve iPhone Gestures with Heatmaps,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write How to Track and Improve iPhone Gestures with Heatmaps Appsee · Follow 5 min read · Jan 2; 2019 -- Ever since Apple swiped left on the home button and introduced new gestures instead; iPhone gestures have become more important than ever for mobile app design. Every iPhone gesture means something about your user: whether they know where to tap and how to navigate; what features they’re interested in; and what frustrates them. If you could see and understand these interactions; you’d know exactly how to make your app better and which UI elements need improvement. That’s where touch heatmaps come in. Touch heatmaps are the mobile industry’s standard for assessing UI and the usability of iPhone gestures. They allow mobile teams to gain an in-depth understanding of user behavior at a glance: what areas users interact with most; what UI elements catch their attention first; and what causes them to quit or abandon the app. In Gartner’s recent Market Guide for Web and Mobile App Analytics; they are called a “struggle detection tool”. How do mobile touch heatmaps work? Touch heatmaps collect; measure; and aggregate every touch interaction users made on each screen of the app. Then; this aggregation is displayed on each screen in the form of a visual overlay of a gradient. Areas colored in blue represent areas with low user interaction; and areas colored in red show a high level of user interaction. Here are five ways to use touch heatmaps to improve your mobile app’s iPhone gestures. Unresponsive gestures In this example of an unresponsive gesture heatmap; you can see that many users are trying to bypass the login/registration screen by swiping — a function that was not included in the app. Unresponsive gestures is one of the most crucial metrics for iPhone gestures and user interface. Only some touch heatmap tools can measure them. Touch heatmaps can be filtered to show you iPhone gestures that were unresponsive and caused user frustration; helping you understand what design flaw is causing the problem. That way you can easily address them before the number of frustrated users grows and starts affecting your reviews and retention rates. Unresponsive gestures can be a huge detriment to your app’s retention rates. They cause users to quit; kill; and ultimately abandon the app. Unresponsive gestures can happen because of a variety of factors. Sometimes users expect the app to behave in a certain way and their expectations are not met; for example they try to swipe to get to the next screen but the app screen doesn’t include such a function. Sometimes users think a certain element acts as a button when it does not. First gesture on each screen On this login screen; you can see that the most common first gesture is actually tapping on the “back” button; which might explain low conversion rates. First impressions are important. They can make the difference between a first session after which the user abandons the app; or a first session that is the first of many. Understanding the first gesture; especially on onboarding screens; can help understand what users are looking for; improve navigation; and reduce app abandonment. First gestures can elucidate your users’ natural impulses and the way they navigate and interact with your app’s features. If users’ first gestures on a certain screen are not what you expect; it may indicate a problem with the layout or buttons on that screen. It can also hint to you that users are looking for a specific feature; prompting you to highlight the features users desire most. Last gesture on each screen If the last iPhone gesture on a screen is what you’d expect it to be; you can rest easy knowing that this part of the user journey is clear. Gesture UX can have a huge effect on your app’s conversion and retention rates. By filtering iPhone gestures on a touch heatmap to show only the last gesture on each screen; you can see what users did just before they either moved on to the next screen; or quit the app. If the most common last gesture on a specific screen is not the one you’d expect or want the user to make; that might indicate a problem with your button design; layout; CTA; or navigation. For example; in an eCommerce app; you would want users’ last gesture on the “My Cart” screen to be tapping the “pay now” button; to go to the checkout screen and convert. If users are not tapping the “pay now” button as their last gesture; you might want to think about optimizing your CTA button. Most common gestures per screen Heatmaps show you the areas on your interface with which users interact the most; giving you valuable information about user expectations and behavior. Are users behaving the way you intended them to behave? Without touch heatmaps; this would be a very difficult puzzle to solve. The color gradient of touch heatmaps means you can instantly recognize the most common iPhone gestures on any given screen. This function can tell you what catches users’ attention; what they expect your app to do; and what they think is the easiest way to accomplish the task they came to do. If the most common gesture isn’t what you thought it would be; this can help you improve layout and navigation. Least common gestures per screen This touch heatmaps shows that few users tap on the shopping cart option from the navigation menu; since the user interface includes a cart icon more immediately visible on each screen. If there’s one thing mobile apps lack; it’s screen real estate. Even though phones are getting bigger; mobile apps need to pack quite a punch into a relatively small space; but without cramming too many elements onto it. This means that every inch and every pixel of space needs to be carefully planned; designed and optimized. Now imagine that you’re trying to cram design elements onto an already-crowded screen; when your touch heatmap tool tells you that users don’t actually need one of those elements. Suddenly; a whole section of your screen is freed up! With touch heatmaps; you can easily see areas that get less attention. Summary Your users’ gestures provide a lot of hidden clues about your app’s usability; user interface; and iPhone gestures. The color spectrums of touch heatmaps illuminate these clues. Touch heatmaps enable you to instantly understand where users are tapping; which buttons are working best; and which parts of the interface are drawing users’ attention.

Create a Segmented Auto-Moving SMS Code Verification Input in React Native,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write Create a Segmented Auto-Moving SMS Code Verification Input in React Native Jason Brown · Follow Published in codeburst · 6 min read · Jan 2; 2019 102 Many applications provide a way to verify a user based upon a text message. This can be a random code usually 4–6 numbers. It doesn’t really matter as we’ll build an input that can do it all; but one common interaction is auto-advancing inputs when you type. This on the surface can look trivial but can be complex when you are dealing with user interactions like pasting; deleting; and focus management. This tutorial was inspired by logging into Stripe and seeing how they handled their text code verification. This was adapted from web to native. Setup 6 Rectangles 6 is arbitrary this will work with any amount as long as we base our calculations off of the length of the array. We start with a bit of state. We will hold our value in a single string and use the split method to turn it into an array. We will loop over our CODE_LENGTH just so we can grab the index and render in our display value. Our display value will be Views that have their border right the same color and size as the wrap. The wrapping div will provide the border look; and the display pieces will provide the separation on the inside. We will use some logic to remove the border from the last display so we don’t have a double border on the right side from the display and wrap border. If it’s the last input we apply our noBorder style. We also use use alignItems: 'center' and justifyContent: 'center' to center our text inside of each display cell. Setup Our Input We need to get access to our TextInput via a ref so we can control it's focus. We render our TextInput; and one important piece is to put value="". The reason for this is to indicate to React that it's a controlled input; and that even if people type into we never want to display a value. If we left that off the text input would be uncontrolled and would have user input displayed. Instead of displaying the content in the input we have our value split from state and rendered in separate Views. We will render our input absolutely because we will want to control the movement of it later so that we don’t have to fake a cursor but instead move the input to the active cell. Handle Focus/Blur On important piece is controlling focus and blur. We will need to track whether or we have focus so we can display appropriate outlines. So we add a boolean focused value to state; and attach an onFocus and onBlur to our input. Not only that we need to handle what happens when the user presses on the outer wrap. If it’s pressed we need to focus on the input. In React Native we want to use a Touchable element; in our case the TouchableWithoutFeedback since we don’t need any other effects. So we add an onPress and call focus on our ref that we had created earlier. Calling focus directly like this will then trigger our onFocus handler so we don't need to set any state in the handlePress method. Move Our Input One important piece is moving the input. As the user types we will move it starting from position 0 through to the full length of the code. We do this so as the user types the input can display in the cell with a real cursor flashing. We do some math to determine the selected index to multiply by 32 which is just the width of each display cell. If our current length of typed in code is less than the total possible values then we return the values.length which is just the length of characters users have typed in. If we hit the point where the user has typed in all possible characters then we just return the total possible length of characters. This limits the input to always be visible in the last square and no further. Handle Typing Now when the user types we will have our change event fire. Generally you would update state with just updating the value from onChangeText but because we added value="" the value will always be the singular character that the user typed. We are reference previous state so we need to use the callback setState style. Also the handleChange method could be potentially called with more than one character if the user pasted in the number. So to combat any possibility of over pasting past the maximum character limit we will combine the current state; new incoming value; then slice it down to the maximum length. If a user pasted in 8 characters we would grab 0 to 6 in our case and only update the state with the first 6 characters. Also if the current length is greater than or equal to maximum code length we return null. This will prevent typing in more than the allowed amount or characters. Fake Outline Accessibility is important to think about and so we will need to re-create the outline that would normally display when the user has focus. We could add in the outline but choose to do it this way for better design/aesthetic purposes. To accomplish this we need to know if a current cell is selected; or if everything is all filled in. If it’s currently selected we want to render our outline; or if all numbers have been filled in then we want to render the outline in the last input. We do that by comparing the index we are looping over directly to the length of the characters that have been typed in. Then to check if it’s filled we compare length of values typed in and also check if the loop has gotten to the final input. We also need to check if the user is currently focused. If they aren’t focused on the input then we don’t want to render our outline. To render the outline we render another div positioned absolutely. We render our shadow View absolutely and give it a borderWidth of 4. Then we move it left/right/bottom/top -4 so that when the border renders it will line up exactly like an outline. Handle Delete We will need to handle deleting manually because the input doesn’t have any value. So there is no way to detect a value change to remove a number. We can grab the key from the onKeyPress callback and check if it's backspace. If the user is deleting then we can use slice to remove the last character from our value on state. Handle Edge Cases One final edge case is to handle when the user has fully typed in the amount of characters. They can type in 5 characters and be focused on the 6th; but once they type in the final character the selectedIndex will move the input to the right. However if we have all the numbers; the input will be trying to collect a character for stuff we don’t want/need. Typically in React you’d just un-render the input but if the user clicks on our wrapping div we need to have access to the TextInput so we can focus. Otherwise after the user typed in all the numbers they'd have no way to delete them if they got them wrong. To handle this we will check if the user has typed in all characters than just hide the input using opacity. Ending That’s it; we now have an input that auto-advances whenever you type it in and stops when the maximum character limit is reached.

If they aren’t focused on the input then we don’t want to render our outline. To render the outline we render another div positioned absolutely. The display is positioned relative so it will render and cover each individual character display. Then using the box-shadow style we can create that has 0 offset in bother directions; no blur; but a spread-radius. The spread radius will make a 4px border on the outside of the display. Handle Delete We will need to handle deleting manually because the input doesn’t have any value. So there is no way to detect a value change to remove a number. We can grab the key from the onKeyUp callback and check if it's backspace. If the user is deleting then we can use slice to remove the last character from our value on state. Handle Edge Cases One final edge case is to handle when the user has fully typed in the amount of characters. They can type in 5 characters and be focused on the 6th; but once they type in the final character the selectedIndex will move the input to the right. However if we have all the numbers; the input will be trying to collect a character for stuff we don’t want/need. Typically in React you’d just un-render the input but if the user clicks on our wrapping div we need to have access to the input so we can focus. Otherwise after the user typed in all the numbers they'd have no way to delete them if they got them wrong. To handle this we will check if the user has typed in all characters than just hide the input using opacity. Ending That’s it; we now have an input that auto-progresses whenever you type it in and stops when the maximum character limit is reached. Originally published at codedaily.io on January 2; 2019.

Wind Thread Automatically with This DIY Machine,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write Wind Thread Automatically with This DIY Machine Jeremy S. Cook · Follow 2 min read · Jan 2; 2019 7 While you may or may not need to wind thread on a regular basis; this hack by Mr. Innovative will show you how it can be done automatically. The device uses a motor to turn a 3D-printed spool at high speed; pulling thread from a much larger spool positioned vertically at the other end of the assembly. To keep things threaded evenly; a feeding arm is rotated back and forth using a servo. As the thread travels through the assembly; it spins an encoder disk that allows it to sense just how much thread is applied to the smaller roller. An Arduino Uno is used for controlling the machine; along with a custom PCB shield. User interface is provided by a small OLED display that shows thread length; as well as a rotary encoder with a pushbutton input. The device features a manual winding mode; plus a mode that enables it to wind a predefined length of thread. The circuit and code for the build can be found here; and print files are listed on Thingiverse. Parts used are available in the video description if you’d like to create your own; or perhaps you could apply something seen here to your next project!

Understanding Nebulas NOVA (Part 1),Open in app Sign up Sign in Write Understanding Nebulas NOVA (Part 1) Nebulas · Follow Published in Nebulasio · 3 min read · Jan 2; 2019 -- Nebulas NOVA was officially launched on December 31; 2018. Compared to Eagle Nebula; Nebulas Nova has implemented three important features: Nebulas Blockchain Runtime Environment (NBRE); Nebulas Rank (NR); Developer Incentive Protocol (DIP). In the Nebulas Rank Yellow Paper and Developer Incentive Protocol Mauve Paper released in 2018; we have described the design and meaning of NR and DIP core principle in detail. Let’s go over again about the core features of Nebuals NOVA: Nebulas Rank and Developer Incentive Protocol. As the core functions of Nebulas NOVA; Nebulas Rank (NR) and Developer Incentive Protocol (DIP) aim to promote on-chain data sorting and discover value in the blockchain world. Meanwhile; the implementation of Nebulas Rank and Developer Incentive Protocol symbolize that Nebulas enter into Autonomous Metanet; accelerating the development of fair cooperating. For DApp developers; the most notable feature is that this platform will reward developers directly; without users paying for it or advertising; so developers can focus on improving the quality of their DApp . Both NR and DIP algorithm and code are stored on blockchain; they are open-source in a completely transparent manner; and can be upgraded on demand according to the functionality of Nebulas Blockchain Runtime Environment (NBRE). Nebulas Rank (NR) Nebulas Rank (NR) was first proposed in our Nebulas Rank Yellow Paper. NR is designed to provide a native; quantifiable value standard for blockchain accounts. NR is mainly determined by these two factors: The Median Account Stake of the account within a certain period of time; that is; the account needs to hold its asset at least half of the period. The higher the Median Account Stake of an account; the higher its Nebulas Rank. The account’s weighted indegree and outdegree; which reflects the account’s liquidity. Simply put; the higher the transactions amount of an account; the higher its Nebulas Rank. At the same time; all two loop attack are eliminated to prevent users from manipulating their Nebulas Rank. Nebulas Rank combines the basic value of an account with its contribution to the economy; helping to discover valuable accounts and provide a foundation for the subsequent development of applications. It is worth mentioning that Nebulas Rank’s unique Wilbur Function can effectively resist Sybil attack; which means that when a malicious user tries to create two or multiple accounts; it will not increase his overall Nebulas Rank. Developer Incentive Protocol (DIP) First proposed in Nebulas Developer Incentive Protocol Mauve Paper; Developer Incentive Protocol (DIP) is the first application of Nebulas Rank to provide on-chain incentives for DApp developers. DIP proposes a set of voting mechanisms to determine the final reward for each DApp developer; while ensuring fairness: The total number of user votes is linked to an account’s Nebula Rank. Because the Nebulas Rank of a new account is low; a developer cannot create side accounts to increase his reward. Users who vote for different DApps can increase their overall voting power. We encourage each user to try multiple DApps. The final reward distribution mechanism effectively prevents developers from splitting a DApp into multiple ones to increase their total rewards. These anti-fraud properties of Developer Incentive Protocol helps to build a stable environment for Nebulas; DApp developers and users to maintain a positive relationship; and achieve sustainable and prosperous development of the Nebulas ecosystem. With the launch of Nebulas Rank and Developer Incentive Protocol; Nebulas has become the public chain to create on-chain incentives and to discover the value of blockchains. By the first quarter of 2019; developers can deploy their smart contracts on Nebulas NOVA and receive DIP rewards from their smart contracts. And through Nebulas Rank; developers can learn whether their smart contracts are popular in the market; therefore to upgrade accordingly and develop a more popular and valuable DApp. Learn more about Nebulas: Official website: Nebulas.io Github: github.com/nebulasio/go-nebulas Slack: nebulasio.herokuapp.com Telegram(EN): t.me/nebulasio Twitter: @nebulasio Sign up to discover human stories that deepen your understanding of the world.

Storytelling for Engineers — Vol.2,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write Photo by Nong Vang on Unsplash Storytelling for Engineers — Vol.2 Stefano Mosconi · Follow Published in HackerNoon.com · 5 min read · Jan 2; 2019 134 Every time I was going to my boss I would get the same answer: “Don’t come to me with problems; come to me with solutions”. I would get so frustrated because I thought I was going with solutions… for the love of god I am an engineer! I’m a master at exactly that: solving problems. I would tweak the slides a little bit; take stuff away; VERY IMPORTANT stuff that apparently wasn’t understood and then go back. Same story. I would have to go back again and again; countless times. Frustration kept mounting and I used to get mad at “the others”. Until I started understanding that the problem wasn’t “the others” but it was me. More specifically: the way I was presenting things. As engineers we get in love with the details; we get in love with the technology and the inner workings of the world. Photo by Pat Taylor on Unsplash Like any good watchmaker we know how clocks work and could spend hours talking about the cogs and the levers that are inside a watch. Watches are fashion items though. Nobody in their right mind would talk about the cogs and the levers if they wanted to sell a watch to anyone. Everyone would talk about the quadrant; the leather wristband; the price. Very few have the time to put into understanding the details and even if they had probably it wouldn’t help you very much to sell your idea. Give me the exec summary So here’s the executive summary: Technology is flooding the world of business and tech guys and girls (i.e. you that are reading this) are more and more needed to make business work. What sucks is that on average tech people are not very good at presenting things in a way that everyone else “on the other side” would understand them. Because of this decisions are taken without apparently really listening to the tech guys. And it sucks. Big Time. How do I know? I know because I sucked at doing this myself. That’s when I started to realize I really needed to get better at telling stories. Since I am an engineer I needed a framework; something to make my life easier when building presentations. Something logic. Something that would make sense. At the beginning was a bullet point list I started to study the art of presenting with the hope I could extract the science from it and understand the things that were behind the most successful presenters. I started working with a bullet point list; a pretty simple one: - Opening - Body - Conclusion That made a lot of sense but many things were left out. I added a few more things on the side: - Key message - Audience - Occasion Sometimes I would start from the Audience; sometimes from the occasion. Sometimes I just wanted to focus on the key message first. Other times the opening was the thing that sparked my creative vein (assuming that I had one :D ). A bullet point list wasn’t cutting it. It was too constraining; too sequential; too limiting. So I thought to build a mind map. But again it was just a bullet list on steroids; too dispersive… I couldn’t have everything under control at once. That’s when I saw the “Business Model Generation” book on my table and I thought: “Hey what if I use a Canvas?” And that’s pretty much how it started working by itself (thanks Alex!). Then it turned into a canvas With the Presentation Design Canvas I could think at everything and write the script of the speech pretty much right away. In 20 minutes I could jot down the main things and stop staring at the powerpoint for hours. It saved me a gazillion of time. You can see the Presentation Design Canvas below and download the PDF high-res version here. This Canvas is condensing years of work; study and experiences into an A4. It’s a tool and like any tool it really depends on you to learn how to use it. Like a hammer once you have this everything will start to look like a nail. Even this blog post was first conceived on the Canvas itself. It’s a tool to send messages and prepare yourself to withstand a crowd. It helps you think about the key areas that often you forget to think about. It increases your empathy because it helps you be in other’s shoes. And as a plus it’s freaking logical :) Do me a favour I hope that with this engineers around the world will be more and more able to tell stories to everyone; regardless of their tech prowess. Because it sucks to not be understood. That feeling is something that I personally hated so much that I needed to do something about it. It’s not just for engineers of course; it works great with every type of person but as an engineer I know that I really needed this and I know that people like me really appreciate it. If you like this idea; please do me a favour and share it around; like it and send the link to a friend that needs it; if you share the link above I will be able to know who has downloaded it and grow the community using it. Thank you! 🙏 This is a follow-up to another post I wrote a couple of year ago; that is how long it took me to come up with a solution to that problem :) Sign up to discover human stories that deepen your understanding of the world.

The Automation of Creativity,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write The Automation of Creativity Diane · Follow 6 min read · Jan 2; 2019 -- 1 This is the full version of my piece published on Queen’s Business Review. A rtificial Intelligence. The term has become ubiquitous in this digital age. Highly complex; opaque yet celebrated. We are grateful for the ease it brings through recommendation engines on retail; music and streaming platforms. Nevertheless; overwhelming choices have led us to trade in our purchasing behaviour and transaction data for an algorithm that simply reinforces our own tastes of the past. What is “taste?” How is it possible that the world’s most valuable company built an empire reimagining appearance of an ancient consumer-electronics industry; receive as many praises as criticism for their “timeless design?” Through a philosophical lens; natural taste is “not a theoretical knowledge; it is a quick and exquisite application of rules which we do not even know.” The unknowingness of whether something is tasteful to us cannot be measured or captured by a singular algorithm. Companies such as Facebook and Amazon dominate our digital identities — sorting us into behaviour-based clusters. Even with top Ph.D. hires; algorithms in these companies are heavily reliant on tracking our past behaviours; limiting our field of vision to extensions of the rearview mirror as opposed to organically new and creative content we may find tasteful down the road. Before Netflix dictated our next show and Amazon suggested our next purchase; we had to discover and make these choices for ourselves. The friction between decisions led to the consideration of various options; and through this; we aggregated our unique personal taste. It is time to recognize the implications behind how advanced technologies of the modern day; such as artificial intelligence; may do more to set us back than propel us forward. Behind the noisy celebrations of buzzwords; algorithms are quietly curating and promoting generic content that can drastically alter our personal tastes. Perhaps one of the greatest examples is a platform that boasts 83 million active users in a bid to define and rework artistic taste. In 2017; Spotify listeners spent half their time on the app exclusively listening to playlists. The service serves up a weekly “Discover” playlist that’s reportedly fine-tuned to each listener’s preference based on their Spotify “taste profile.” The playlist is curated strictly by machine and aims to find songs for the user that feed their particular music appetite. However; in a post by avid Spotify user Adam Pasick in Quartz; he outlines his shock when he heard the exact same tracks being played in a coffee shop as his Discover playlist. Homero; a barista and band member; was “given a nearly identical mixtape” as Adam that week. The reality that even having two billion playlists filtered through a supposedly advanced algorithm can still churn out identical results for two different listeners; proves the threat of AI promoting generic taste and content for all. In 2015; EDM artist Tiesto released “Burn” on Spotify; a piece commissioned directly by the music streaming service catered for their workout playlists. Burn was created specifically to adapt to the running pace tempo of any listener. Unfortunately; the intent of artistic creation in the music industry has drastically progressed in this direction. The practice of making music designed to game algorithms and be successfully picked up by a Spotify playlist has inevitably created an era of “easy music.” George Ergatoudis; the former head of content at Spotify; admits that the industry is moving towards creation centred around understanding streaming algorithms: “There are pitches for specific playlists more often now. This didn’t happen even a year ago.” When artists notice that virality and popularity are being prioritized for vanilla musicians; they start to credit their idiosyncratic and unique musical styles as inferior. The intent of creating future music for the sake of pure artistic expression and vision is dwindling as a victim of demand for AI-driven homogeneity. Furthermore; the potential of challenging; innovative and groundbreaking music has been put at stake. Algorithms like Spotify’s favour spikes in listenership and viral content. Studies have shown that consistently working safe and “easy music” into all playlists are fundamentally changing listeners’ collective preference and taste for what they consider a “good song” in the future. The Spotify-induced phenomenon of “lean back listening” has consequently spawned a new genre of music creation. Algorithmically optimized playlists entitled: “Ambient Chill;” “Chill Covers;” and the particularly popular “Chill Tracks” with over 2.4 million followers place easygoing and anesthetized tracks at the fingertips of listeners. A label owner commented bluntly; “the more vanilla the release; the better it works for Spotify. If it’s challenging music? Nah.” He continued by stating that much of their comparatively experimental and aggressive music goes unheard on the platform due to unfavourable exposure by Spotify algorithm. “It leaves artists behind. If Spotify is just feeding easy music to everybody; where does the art form go? Is anybody going to be able to push boundaries and break through to a wide audience anymore?” Cultivating an ephemeral culture filled with mainstream pop music can only shape our taste towards uniform linearity and consequently damage authentic creativity in the long run. As Marian Mazzone; an art professor at the College of Charleston eloquently puts it; “Eventually; we may opt to shift our definition of art in order to make accommodation for the [so-called] creativity of artificial intelligence.” What used to be a boundless form of art to release frustration; passion; hunger; anger and personal identity has shrunk to feeding the automation of Musak. The trend parallels across other industries. The Echo Look — Amazon’s take on a computerized fashion advisor — purports to recommend the ideal fashion; style; and taste for each user albeit standing as a lifeless black-box camera on shelves. An interview with the director of a recent Netflix hit: All The Boys I’ve Loved Before; Susan Johnson; reveals that the movie was requested solely based on Netflix’s digital analysis. “[Netflix has] teams everywhere literally looking for what people are searching for. So they realized that people were looking for romantic comedies.” Evidently; investing in a film-version of the novel was not a consequence of Netflix investing in creativity; but in fuelling their commercial algorithm. Johnson even called the process “a little Big Brother;” with Netflix controlling what and how we consume. Moreover; Netflix stated that their recommendation algorithm “influences choice for about 80% of hours streamed” on the service. Thus; Netflix’s own content will undoubtedly benefit; being forcefully advertised regardless of each viewer’s true taste preference. In the end; not only was All The Boys I’ve Loved Before a mega-success; but it helped the service influence over 80 million subscribers to watch content in the rom-com genre for the remainder of Summer. Talk about generalizing taste. In actuality; the increasing role of artificial intelligence does not make our fashion sense or music tastes more distinct — but instead silos us into a homogenizing box; calculating where we land in the “average” identity. The fact that these average identities come in minute shades (a song or two different on the Discover playlist); only means that they are far from unique. Artificial Intelligence is undoubtedly shaping individual choices and the wider social fabric at every moment. Taken individually; it appears that sacrificing privacy and data is worthwhile for the ease of convenience and efficiency. Presently; at scale; our preferences are being driven by the hands of the massive technology companies whom we’ve handed the wheel. In this case; the salient tradeoff in this glossy AI age is not privacy; but our personal taste and identity. The manipulation of an entire industry led by Spotify’s algorithms has become the operating motive and expected standard for music lovers and artists. Conforming to the algorithm game stifles innovation borne of colliding tastes and ideas. Needless to say; colouring outside of the lines is nearly impossible when constrained in a future of singular taste and bland inspiration. The subtle yet damaging outcome of displacing the judgment of taste to algorithms will inevitably rob us of our humanity. In all; we should tread gently on our reliance on leading-edge technology; remaining wary of its threatening ability to suppress true novelty and cultivate a homogenous view on creativity.

Pipeline Inspection Robot Prototype,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write Pipeline Inspection Robot Prototype Jeremy S. Cook · Follow 2 min read · Jan 2; 2019 -- 1 Pipes deteriorate deteriorate and may need to be inspected. Fortunately; robots are available for this job; meaning humans don’t always have to be directly involved in this labor intensive and even dangerous task. These robots; however; are extremely expensive. This project aims to construct an alternative to those that are on the market; with a structure that can adapt to pipes of various diameters. The robot that the team came up with uses a pair of three-wheel roller assemblies arranged at 120 degrees for contact along the pipe’s inner diameter. Each wheel is attached to a linkage assembly that connects it to a central spring; designed to contract and expand as necessary to maintain pressure on the pipe; even if the diameter changes. For locomotion; two of the three front wheels are driven by powerful gear motors; pulling the rest of the robot with it. Control is accomplished via an Arduino Uno and an L298N H-bridge board. As of now; it’s been shown to work well 300mm and 320mm horizontal pipes; and can roll like a car through larger diameters as well. One could see this type of design expanded in the future with three- or six-wheel drive and perhaps active control of the wheel linkages. This could then allow for better maneuverability or use in vertical piping. Sign up to discover human stories that deepen your understanding of the world. Free Distraction-free reading. No ads.

2019 Forecast: Amara’s Law,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write 2019 Forecast: Amara’s Law Kim Bellard · Follow Published in Tincture · 5 min read · Jan 2; 2019 17 I have two predictions for 2019. One is that at the end of 2019 our healthcare system will still look a lot like it looks now. Oh; sure; we’ll see some cool new technologies; some innovative start-ups; some surprising corporate pairings; some moves by Big Tech; and some promising clinical findings. But our healthcare system moves slowly; and many in it have strongly vested interests in the status quo. The second prediction is that; more than ever; Amara’s Law still prevails. In case you don’t know this “law;” it is attributed to Roy Amara; who was President of the Institute for the Future; among other things; and goes like this: We tend to overestimate the effect of a technology in the short run and underestimate the effect in the long run. There are several technologies which impact; but are not exclusive to; healthcare; that I believe we’re in that short run of. I’m going to talk about three in particular: data; and gene editing; and artificial intelligence. Data: We’re finally coming to realize how our personal data is not just at risk from hacking; but from the very institutions we’ve been entrusting to it; such as Facebook or Google. Our data is being analyzed; bought and sold; manipulated; and used to target us in ways that we still don’t fully understand; Legislators and regulators are waking up to this; such as in Europe (GDPR) or California (Consumer Privacy Act). At the same time; there are signs that the long-awaited healthcare interoperability may be closer on the horizon than ever. Apple’s Health Records initiative and ONC’s Trusted Exchange Framework and Common Agreement are encouraging examples. Here’s the thing we’re not still getting: we’re never going to go back to any Golden Age of privacy; if there ever was one. Data about you is going to be collected; and shared; by an ever-increasing number of devices in an ever-increasing number of ways from an ever increasing number of entities. E.g.; it’s not just your phone; it’s every device your phone interacts with. It’s not just your phone; it’s your wearable; your implants; your car; the street cameras; and so on. Your EHR will talk not just to other EHRs but to; well; just about everything. Future versions of us will laugh at the notion that interoperability was ever an issue; or that we’d have control over our data. We are not ready for a world in which there will be so much data about us; so widely available; and used in ways that haven’t even been invented yet. Credit: Medical Research Council Gene Editing Much furor resulted from the recent claim that a Chinese researcher had genetically edited babies. It’s not ethical! We haven’t set rules yet! But no one can really claim to have been surprised: it was only a matter of time before someone; somewhere; did something like this. We’ve gone from needing huge research efforts to sequence the human genome to being able to sequence our own for a few hundred dollars. CRISPR is making gene editing dangerously easy. Current gene therapies remain very pricey — and will remain so if pharma has its way — but they will become much more widespread. One of two things will happen; both with profound implications. One is that gene editing remains very expensive — perhaps out of the reach of most insurance. Wealthy people would then disproportionately benefit from them; widening the current health inequities between rich and everyone else. Only these advantages would become genetically baked in. Or we’ll have these therapies widely available; as happened with sequencing. Anybody and everyone could tailor their genes and the genes of their children; not just “fixing” defects but altering them to suit personal preferences. Genes wouldn’t even have to remain entirely “human.” Current genetic differences may seem trivial. We are not ready for a world where some; or even most; can tailor their genetic make-up; in ways we haven’t thought of. Artificial Intelligence A.I. has been promised literally for decades; and has consistently proved harder to achieve than expected. As 2019 starts; though; there would be few who do not think that A.I. is going to play increasingly important roles in our lives. In healthcare; A.I. leaders like IBM Watson or Babylon Health may have suffered some recent embarrassing setbacks. but there seems to be growing; if sometimes grudging; consensus that A.I. is going to used; especially to augment human doctors. A.I. will; in this scenario; be able to analyze the data; sort through all the research; interpret the diagnostics; and assist doctors in diagnosing and pinpointing treatments. Not using it would be like not using MRIs or prescription drugs. We don’t get it. A.I. isn’t just going to augment physicians and other clinicians. It isn’t going to exactly replace them either; doing what humans do but faster and more accurately. They’re going to do new things. For example; Sandip Panesar recently wrote of the approaching surgical singularity. He reports on how AI-controlled surgical robots are already operating on animals; and foresees when this moves to human patients. They will have skills no human could hope for; and be able to do surgeries no human would dare. Google’s DeepMind AlphaZero has taught itself complex games like chess and Go; and plays in ways that aren’t like a human; but are new and surprising. As Cornell professor Steven Strogatz wrote; “It was humankind’s first glimpse of an awesome new kind of intelligence.” Moreover; it is a kind of intelligence that we may not be able to understand. In healthcare; it will find health problems and design treatments that we never could have and that it may not be able to “explain.” A.I. won’t be physically constrained; won’t have a limited number of patients; and will be omnipresent. More significantly; traditional healthcare approaches like medical licensing or maintenance of certification aren’t going to be applicable. We are not ready for a healthcare system where our “doctors” are; for the most part; not humans — nor think like them. Credit: Freedom and Society We tend to think about the future as being very much like the present but with better tools; when; in fact; those tools change us and our institutions in ways we hadn’t expected. So it will be with these technologies. As exciting as 2019 may be for healthcare; it will be the calm before the storm. Follow Kim on Medium and on Twitter (@kimbbellard)!

Towards A More ‘Digital-Dense’ Smallholder Farmer,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write Towards A More ‘Digital-Dense’ Smallholder Farmer A discussion on field data; technological value chains; and a worm’s-eye view of the global future of agriculture. Arable · Follow 8 min read · Jan 2; 2019 2 Solidaridad is a nearly 50 year-old global network that focuses on sustainable production in 13 commodity groups; 11 of which are in agriculture. Based in nine regional hubs over 40 countries; they work with small- and medium-scale farmers growing crops such as sugarcane; fruit & vegetables; cotton; soybeans; and wheat & barley. These farmers are embedded in tight supply chains; and recognize the advantage to tracking all quantifiable aspects of their production; not only for their own edification; but for downstream buyers and consumers seeking demonstrable quality through traceability. Arable’s Jess Bollinger spoke with Mandla Nkomo; Managing Director of Solidaridad Southern Africa; about digital agriculture’s role in empowering small-scale farmers to build their knowledge base and make informed; data-driven decisions about their livelihoods and the goods they produce. Arable Labs: Mandla; before working at Solidaridad; you worked with farmers at TechnoServe. Can you tell us more about your background; and how long you’ve worked in agriculture? Mandla Nkomo: I am very passionate about two things: getting agriculture production right; and making sure we are creating opportunities for smallholder farmers to participate in global value chains. In other words; making it inclusive. I am actually a biochemist by training; with no formal training in agriculture; but agriculture has always been a passion. I started out working in a laboratory at an agriculture company; which allowed me to do both. When I transferred to Technoserve; I already knew; practically speaking; how integration works; and what the end user should do in terms of packaging the connections. Technoserve allowed people to do it at scale; across a number of companies and a number of value chains. Now I’m doing the same at Solidaridad; with a sharper focus on sustainability and value chains; and how digital can be leveraged. AL: Can you give us some background on the goals of Solidaridad? MN: Solidaridad has been around for 50 years; transitioning quite a bit from supporting activist movements in Central America towards supply chains in commodities. Looking at coffee; cocoa; and sugarcane; these are all big; global supply chains. We strongly feel that the current production system in the world is unsustainable; if we are going to deliver food for 9 billion people; things cannot go on business-as-usual. When we look at supply chains; we look at everything we can leverage; focusing on the core pillars of sustainability and inclusivity. They are important in defining everything about how we interact with that sector. AL: Textiles are outside core agricultural commodities; but are included in Solidaridad’s mandate. Why is that? MN: Textiles use a large amount of water and energy; we can make these more efficient. Same with the gold sector and mining. If we participate in creating standard operating procedures; we can add value to making those sectors sustainable. AL: How do you scale this efficiency globally? MN: When we did our MASP [Multi Annual Strategic Plan]; one of the things that became very clear was that we needed to have a clear digital strategy; or we would not be in existence. This allowed us to bring in Shungu Kanyemba; Director of IT at Solidaridad; helping us integrate digital tools. I don’t have to preach this to you: digital is a great equalizer. It makes the world flat; and shines the spotlight on areas often left out. Where we previously had to rely on third- and fourth-hand information; now we have direct information. Mandla Nkomo (left) compares the Arable Mark to traditional weather stations in conversation with government extension officers in Katete; Zambia. It’s very clear to us that it doesn’t matter which vertical you are looking at: everyone is adapting to a digitally enabled way of doing business. The investment we are making in terms of hardware; partnerships; and software — when you and I first met; we talked about how to make complex technology available at the bottom of the pyramid where it is going to have the greatest impact in changing things. AL: Where do you see change happening first; and how? MN: I’m glad you asked that. If you look at the value chain from start to finish; almost every activity lends itself to improvement using technology. We’ve been busy trying to integrate a number of tools to make a ‘digital-dense’ smallholder farmer. We want to know stuff about a smallholder farmer that he doesn’t know about himself. Worm’s-eye stuff. Stuff below the surface: nutrients in the soil; humidity in the soil. Previously this wasn’t possible; or if it was possible; it was very inefficient. AL: Where do you see room for the most improvement through technology? MN: A good example of this is soil testing; usually the domain of government institutions. If you are a farmer of any size; you are going to take a sample and ship it a couple hundred miles to some unknown place; where they do the test and in six months you get your results. Most input support programs are not based on fundamentals like how many nutrients are in the soil; it’s just a generic fertilizer recommendation. This leads to underapplying; overapplying; or applying fertilizer that never gets in the crop — which is expensive! Now; we have the ability to test in 15 minutes; and to let the farmer know the status of his soil composition and pH balance. We go a step further and make crop recommendations best suitable for his soil based on the results. If the farmer insists on a particular crop; we will give recommendations on the type and quantity of fertilizer necessary for that particular crop. This enables farmers to make data-informed decisions at the planning stage; ultimately impacting the quality and quantity of their yield. We are working with 40;000–50;000 farmers in South Africa; testing the soil and ensuring that they all have access to this data. AL: That’s a great example of innovation as an empowering; real-time decision tool; rather than a mechanism that keeps farmers dependent on technology to interpret what is happening in front of them. MN: Let’s talk about the Arable Mark we posted on Twitter. This Mark is located in rural Zambia; next to a weather station contraption that requires 10 square meters to set up and has all types of instructions. Meanwhile; the little Arable Mark is doing all types of data calculation. I asked the site operator: When is the last time you got data from the weather station at this site? And he said they’ve never seen the data from that station. But with the Arable Mark; I could go online and immediately see the data from the past 24 hours. He was just blown away. Using open source satellite technology; we now have the tools to provide deep insight to help decision-making at the smallholder farmer level. AL: That’s especially important in Africa. MN: Yields on the African continent are still quite sub-optimal; we can change that with what we’ve got in our hands right now. If we could deploy 100;000 Marks in South Africa; we would have the most comprehensive view of weather in South Africa. If that information is shared with extension officers; we would have farmers planting at the right time. If we had information about plant health and disease incidence earlier; we could act. We wouldn’t have to wait for an extension officer to get on a bike and ride out to check on the field. We have the tools now — it’s on us to use them. AL: Tell us what you think the next generation of farming looks like. Who are the key players besides the farmers themselves; and what are their roles? MN: Solidaridad is building strategic partnerships with knowledge institutes in South Africa; such as the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research. We work to create a pathway to allow their technologies to be tested in the field. Also; working with Zambia Agriculture Research Institute; we have offered ourselves as a conduit for not just digital but biotech and breeding technology to reach the field. Secondly; we are creating internships for students in agricultural colleges and institutions to work with us alongside smallholder farmers. They read textbooks about how agriculture is done in the US; and work with us in integrating technology in the field. Students in rural Mozambique teaching farmers how to navigate mobile apps. (courtesy Mandla Nkomo) AL: Is this part of your rural ‘agropreneurship’ model? MN: This model is the delivery method for all these technologies. Whether it’s improved seeds or deploying Arable Marks; you need a purveyor. We see this as a great opportunity to connect young people; who are already digitally fluent; both financially and socially. Just look at pictures from the field where Shungu’s team is training farmers on some of the apps that we have built for them. AL: From the buyer’s standpoint; what are the biggest risks in purchasing products from smallholder farmers? How does digital agriculture help to reduce those risks? MN: For me this is where it’s quite exciting. We’ve got one of the big food processing companies in South Africa buying $1Bn of commodities. They can do all the planning in the world; but they are always let down by the lack of information from growers. If the crop is going to be late; it impacts how they set up their processing plant and logistics. They don’t know until it’s too late. They were very clear to us that the ability to use independently verifiable information makes a huge difference to them. They want to manage their portfolio of suppliers using soil information; Arable Mark data; and farmer input. When we add in possibilities with the insurers and bankers; it becomes even more exciting. We are running a model with the Marks in Mozambique with an agro dealer selling seed; providing both the dealer and insurer weather data that validates Sentinel data. Instead of having general insurance; we have precision insurance. Currently; insurance will cover people within 4-5 microclimates receiving the same level of insurance; but they are not experiencing the same loss. The Arable Marks provide more specific information; allowing them to have better data and greater efficiency in the insurance system. AL: Solidaridad is a global network. What has your experience been in the Southern Africa region? MN: We’ve got a central office in Johannesburg; then have satellite offices with field staff that provide field support in Malawi; Zambia and Mozambique. We are driven by this one thing: the issues we are trying to solve are ancient. I spent time in a part of Zambia where there is massive deforestation because people harvest the trees to manufacture charcoal; which they then sell in the city for people needing energy. This is not the type of problem you can solve slowly: it’s urgent. Guess what one of the drivers is: agriculture is not paying farmers well; because their yields are sub-economic. At the basic level; they are applying fertilizer while not knowing what the soil needs; they don’t know the rainfall or the proper planting dates. The longer it takes to digitally enable these farmers; the longer we are going to have these deforestation issues. It’s not a ‘nice to have’ to play around with these Marks. It’s urgent. We can see the potential danger if agriculture does not change in Africa. To learn more about Arable and the work we do with farmers around the globe; visit our web site.

Securitizing Industry 4.0: The Next Revolution,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write Securitizing Industry 4.0: The Next Revolution Augmate · Follow 3 min read · Jan 3; 2019 -- 1 By Mike Rogers; CPA; Digital Asset Advisor for Augmate Corporation. Industrial revolutions are profound periods of human ingenuity and rapid technological advancements; in which economic systems and social structures are transformed. The Third Industrial Revolution; called the “Digital Revolution;” was characterized by the digitization of data and widespread propagation of information. However; the Digital Revolution lacked adequate data security; digitized records were vulnerable to modification; deletion and theft. Today; the Fourth Industrial Revolution is underway; and emerging technologies; such as blockchain; are not only securing digital transactions; but also forming an entirely new ecosystem. This novel ecosystem’s core components include the Internet of Things (IoT); Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS); and reimagined networks of shared computing services. Unprecedented advancements in communication and connectivity are generating an exponential quantity of data; renewing the need for security. Industry 4.0 technologies are expediting the creation of a more secure data-driven digital ecosystem. Augmate is harnessing the power of IoT; blockchain; and AI to provide our users with device-to-device intelligence and enhanced human-to-machine connectivity. Augmate Connect; built from the ground up for IoT and wearables; is a next-generation device management platform that reduces the threat of endpoint vulnerability and hacking. Our technologies are contributing to a disruptive movement transforming business operations worldwide. The velocity of disruptive innovation is accelerating across all industries due to digital transformation. Customer-oriented experiences are central to the digital economy; as data-enhanced services and products are becoming the new normal. To keep up with these changes; organizations are forming innovation-focused partnerships. Strategic resource and knowledge sharing creates significant value for all parties; as well as the ecosystems in which they operate. Augmate’s partnership with Securitize is the premier example of collaborative innovation within the digital security industry. Augmate has high ethical standards and prioritizes open communication with all of its’ stakeholders; our practices ensure accountability; fairness; and transparency. In order to best comply with these ethical standards and security laws in the U.S.; Augmate partnered with Securitize; a Software as a Service (SAAS) platform that simplifies the issuance and ongoing management of regulatory compliant digital securities. Securitize’s Digital Securities (DS) Protocol white paper sets a dual mandate “to consider the full lifecycle of digital securities ownership; beyond issuance; as well as the goals of the different stakeholders: issuers; investors; and exchanges.” Augmate’s “ MATE” digital security leverages smart contracts to automate compliance and provide streamlined services for all stakeholders. By registering and creating a blockchain-protected Ethereum wallet on Augmate’s Securitize portal; investors can participate in a limited offering of our MATE digital securities. Securitize’s fluid and adaptive ownership architecture serves as a framework for creating the DS Services infrastructure. A well-defined and comprehensive DS Services infrastructure enables support for third party DS Apps. These smart contracts trigger digital security lifecycle events; including initial issuance; voting rights; and dividend distributions; among others. Supporting third party apps democratizes the Securitize platform and increases the opportunities for all stakeholders to benefit. Our strategic partnership with Securitize embodies the unique nature of the Fourth Industrial Revolution: it fuses different disciplines and industries by leveraging cybertech to drive a new; non-linear evolution of society; innovation and global finance.

Steps I Took To Land My First Tech Internship,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write Photo by Venveo on Unsplash Steps I Took To Land My First Tech Internship Here are some steps I took to better myself as a candidate for a tech internship. Use this advice to land your first internship or job! Suprith Aireddy · Follow Published in DataDrivenInvestor · 4 min read · Jan 2; 2019 -- Getting your first internship is a big deal. It’s your foot in the door to your career in technology. This internship will help you tremendously to land your first job. After a year of developing my skills; I landed my first internship during my junior year of college. Now here are some things I did to better myself as a candidate. Attend Hackathons! For those of you that lack experience or personal projects; this is the number one step I recommend. Hackathons are open; inclusive; environments for people of all developer levels to better their skills. It’s where you meet up form a team and create a solution. This solution can be anything your team wants to build. Hackathons are a place to learn from mentors and other like-minded people in your community. Attending a hackathon changed my life for the better. I learned more in the 36 hours of continuous coding than I did in 1 year of schooling. They helped me add projects to my resume and introduced me to potential employers. Also; they are completely free! Most of them even reimburse you for your travel needs. So what are you waiting for? The Official 2019 Season North America Hackathon Schedule Find; compete; and earn points for your school at the largest; most diverse student hackathons in the world. mlh.io Click the above link before and sign up to as many as you can attend! Create an effective resume Many candidates simply get overlooked or lost in the system because they don’t have an effective resume. Here are some things to consider when creating your resume. Template I use this template right here and it has given me the best results. It’s simple; elegant; and clean. I recommend this template but as long as your resume has those three characteristics you should be fine. deedy/Deedy-Resume A one page ; two asymmetric column resume template in XeTeX that caters to an undergraduate Computer Science student … github.com Make your name easily visible Recruiters have very little time to scan through the thousands of resumes they receive. By making your name big and bold; it will be very easy for them to remember who you are. This sounds simple but it’s very effective. Make your name the biggest thing on your resume. Include necessary information This is very simple. Remove anything on your resume that is not tech related. Remove the objective or summary. Recruiters tend to not read that at all. When listing previous experiences; highlight company names; positions and include graduation date. Important content should be higher up on the page. Again; use the template above for how to list information. Don’t make your resume a maze. Have clear outlined sections so that recruiters can see things without being overwhelmed. Include technical details. When listing experiences and projects; list things that you have impacted by your code. Did you improve run time by x amount? Give them quantified information. Create a personal website Having a personal website tells the recruiter that you are very passionate about coding. It shows them that you have the ability and skill to do things outside of a classroom setting. By creating a personal website you will stand out of the crowd and will be considered more than the other candidates. Apply Apply Apply! Getting your first gig is almost like a numbers game with a little bit of luck. When you don’t have the luxury of having a big network; it is very difficult to get interviews. That being said; I recommend you apply to as many job postings as you can. I applied to about 5–8 postings a day for about 2 straight months. I heard back from about 33% of them and was rejected without an interview for the rest. When applying; keep in mind to cater your resume to the job postings needs.

Spiritual Technology — A white paper,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write Spiritual Technology — A white paper Mayank Agrawal · Follow 22 min read · Jan 2; 2019 See beyond what’s visible… Introduction Delve into the best of 5000 year old; ‘spiritual technology’ based on unparalleled wisdom of authentic yoga practices and scriptures. Understand it’s practical relevance today and find solutions for our biggest problems in the modern world. While living in this glamorous material world; we remain fascinated and frustrated at the same time. Therefore; its important for us to be able to open a spiritual window to rejuvenate with fresh air of transcendental bliss. The intended goal is to describe this window; which is covered by drapes of ignorance and conditioning; these drapes can be opened by process of Yoga and then light of transcendental knowledge and spiritual bliss shines through. The ‘spiritual technology’ was at it’s peak few thousand years back. It was highly developed and prevalent in practice. It was called ‘Yoga’ because it culminated the entire lifestyle of an Vedic society. Yoga means union of everything. Hence Yoga is the process; which defines and inculcates; every action a person (a Yogi) performs both individually and collectively as a member of an elite Yogic society. Using this spiritual technology humans had created a pristine civilization which lived in complete harmony with nature. Everyone had abundance of satisfaction and happiness. The technology in itself was sufficient in providing a long fulfilling and healthy life. It tapped into fulfilling the real needs of all living beings. It extracted from human beings their inherent sense of goodness and morality; via practical actions that suited the circumstances of their particular time and place. History and Background Like many great modern nations or civilizations of the past were formed under the leadership of great men. For example; United States of America became a great a nation after a few learned; highly intellectual and good meaning men came together and signed the constitution of this country. Similarly; in India many thousand of years back; a great culture based on solely around spirituality was developed. It was built with the instructions and examples of great Saints who were extreme Yogis in their own right. They were also learned; intelligent and highly self realized. The key differentiating factor of these magnificent Saints; was that they were very advanced in spiritual knowledge. There were always the others; who were Yogis and had done severe austerities to attain esoteric mystic powers. But the Saints were not interested in mystic powers. They were aware of the absolute truth and principles of eternal religion. They were brought up in an environment where they went through the Yogic practices of meditation and scriptural studies; while maintaining a very simple and sober lifestyle. Hence they had developed the knowledge and determination to do the right thing. They could then also concentrate on the right thing for many long hours without flickering. They had developed the right desire from within their heart and were only eager for welfare of all living entities. Above all they knew who the Supreme God is and how to work in harmony with his plans. With these qualifications these Saints developed Yogic processes for different classes of people to achieve perfection. And the entire society including the ruling class functioned under the direct guidance of the Saints. Hence; everyone was happy and satisfied. The general people were very active while performing their prescribed duties but they were never anxious. They never lamented nor worried about success or failure. The basic tenant of how this is possible can be understood; by understanding the desires of all living beings. At a very basic level; we have five ‘senses organs’ (eyes; nose; mouth; ears and sense of touch); and the there are unlimited ‘sense objects’ (like delicious food; fragrances; music; movies; sports; clubs; intercourse etc) that we enjoy via our sense organs. Mind is actually considered the sixth sense organ and with sense objects like thoughts; feelings; ideas; knowledge; philosophy; humor; sense of goodness etc. Ultimately; everyone wants to be happy and enjoy; this tendency is inherent in our nature. And we derive happiness while enjoying one or more sense objects perceiving them through our senses and finally enjoying them in our mind and intelligence. This process of happiness is called ‘sense gratification’. Happiness or pleasure derived through sense gratification is aways very temporary. A lot of hard labour is also needed to enjoy these fleeting pleasures. A real life situation everyone can relate to; is the family time or gathering with friends that we set aside to be happy with them. If the plans and activities in such family gatherings or outing with friends or just vacations are carefully scrutinized. One can see that they all revolve around different activities of sense gratification. To list a few common ones; dinner plans; intoxication; gossiping; intellectual yet non-sensical discussions; watching movies and late night drama activities. We often allow ourselves some extra freedom in such occasions and often cross self set limits on enjoying one or the other sense gratification. The Saints and people in general of the Vedic civilization understood this concept really well. They knew that such temporary happiness is useless. They understood that sense gratification is only source of anxiety and distraction from the real purpose of life. The Vedic knowledge clearly declares that this material world (even though very real); is temporary and a place full of miseries. It is impossible to be find true uninterrupted happiness and state of bliss in this material world. Whatever pleasures we find will always be short lived. Fortunately; the Vedic knowledge also explains what is true happiness and the different process (Yogic paths) to achieve them. And ultimately how to achieve the real goal of human life. This process is called as ‘Self Realization’. Hence; knowing both; firstly the fallacies of the material world which dishes out many sense objects for sense gratification to keep us falsely engaged; and second the process (spiritual technology) of achieving true happiness; the Vedic civilization was established. This enabled them to collectively achieve the real purpose of human life. This pristine spiritual knowledge (technology) via revered ancient scriptures and via some extremely potent Yogic practices are still very well preserved. But they are generally hidden under the sloth of modern materialism and various variety of crap. Yet; for those who by good fortune or karma; find authentic Yogic practices find them extremely profound. And hence such intelligent people across the world; are immersing their lives in spirituality (Yoga) and deriving huge benefits. There are numerous practical applications of spiritual knowledge and Yoga processes for this day and age. The Supreme God and his Creations Its very important to talk about the concept of God in the very beginning. It is firmly believed just like how you might believe in gravity; that the Vedic Spiritual Knowledge has directly disseminated from God. There is one Supreme God who is the Creator; Maintainer and Destroyer of this Universe and of all living entities. All living beings are his fragmental parts and he is the best well wisher and benefactor of everyone. Like; every big successful company has one awesome CEO who calls the shots; but there are other leaders like department heads; presidents; directors; managers etc. These other leaders are working very hard and making critical decisions and executing the overall strategy made by the CEO for success of the company. Ultimately; the company was founded by the CEO; he makes the rules and he is the one running the company. Similarly; there is one CEO; of this universe and of all other universes and he is the Supreme God. There are other Demigods who are responsible for different departments of this universe. They are opulent and powerful; and can also bestow upon living beings a lot of material benefits. But they are also ‘created’ by the ‘creator’ the Supreme God. And their lifespan is also temporary like other living beings. Hence; one should not confuse the identity of the one and only Supreme God because of multitude of many religions and other Demigods. In India; there so many celebrated and worshipped; so-called God and Goddesses and millions of temples with many deities. Hence; there are many different faiths and religious institutions; within the Hindu religion itself. This is because of two main reasons. Firstly; a big percentage of the population(almost everyone); have not read and/or understood the Vedic Literature and hence they believe what they have learned from local culture and events growing up. Ultimately; basing their beliefs on their own mental speculation. Secondly; it’s a fact that the Demigods can and do fulfill the mundane material desires of their devotees when they are pleased; that too quickly. Thus affirming the faith of their devotees further. But the Demigods are subsidiary of Supreme God and work under his direction. The Demigods are masters of their own domain; but they are unable to bestow the ‘highest benediction’ possible for a living being. Whereas; the Supreme God is the most powerful and benevolent and can fulfill all desires of his devotees including the highest possible destination. The Demigods and the universes (including all the living beings) that they help maintain are ultimately annihilated at the end of the current cycle. They merge back into the creator; the Supreme God and hence they are all temporary. They are manifested again at the beginning of the next cycle; but the Supreme God remains unaffected; unchanged and eternal. Well what’s the highest possible benediction and how is it better or different from all the success; riches; pleasures and comforts that this material world has on offer. One might think; the highest benediction is; to go heaven; which is perceived as a super awesome and auspicious place with no misery and full of heavenly enjoyment. Heavens are real and can be obtained but they are certainly not the highest benediction. Similarly; obtaining what this material world is offering; is possible for one who endeavors very hard and is serious about his desires. Based on their sacrifices and hard work the Demigods bestow these offerings more of as a matter of universal law; than mercy. The Demigods get pleased by sincere prayers and efforts of their devotees. Therefore; even sinful and wicked people can temporarily enjoy this material world; sometimes to a great extent. But these material riches are always accompanied by anxiety; fear and misery. Life here is a see-saw of oscillating happiness and sadness; just like the eternal cycle of summer and winter seasons. Hence; the highest benediction is beyond the best riches of this material world and it is beyond the wondrous promises of heaven. It is the final destination of all living beings; it is full of sublime knowledge and bliss and it is permanent. It’s completely free from dualities (pleasure and pain) of the material world. It’s full with transcendental emotions and complete understanding of the Supreme God and our own Self. This is the ultimate goal of all spiritual knowledge and Yoga processes. The key point here is; we are all brothers and sisters having the same great grand father; who is the creator of all living beings. Like; Sun bestows its rays and warmth on everyone equally. Similarly; living entities are like the effulgent rays; emanating from the creator; the Supreme God. As he is the Supreme; he is known by many names (or religions); but the creator is one; viz.; the Supreme God is one and eternal. There is no capitalism in the divine factory where living beings are produced; there is indeed monopoly and only one Supreme God is directly and indirectly; manufacturing a very wide variety of living beings and material worlds. Basic Tenants of the Absolute Truth Lets try to fit together a coherent framework; using which we can begin; to delve into the core principles of this ancient wisdom. These can be thought of as pillars and beams supporting; this most gigantic and magnificent building of Vedic knowledge. The basic tenants are enumerated; as we have an inherent need to sort and count. First tenant forms the basis and demarcates the two worlds; material and spiritual. Tenant two through six; explain the material world and our connection with it. The final tenants seven through eleven explain the spiritual world. The goal here is to introduce these concepts and get an understanding of the big picture. These will certainly get you thinking. On the other hand; for sake of conciseness some concepts are not be explained in detail. These tenants are spokes of the wheel of the Absolute Truth; the central part of the wheel; along with the whole wheel itself would get revealed in thorough reading of these concepts. 1>> The world and everything in it can be divided into two broad categories; spiritual and material. The world that we know and experience everyday is the material world. The material world is endless and full of alluring temptations. Material world keep us engaged one way or other. The spiritual world on the other hand is well hidden; it cannot be perceived by mundane senses and intelligence. The spiritual world is eternal; blissful and our original nature and source. And now that we are somehow or the other in the material world. We must use this life to prepare for going back to the spiritual world. 2>> Our body; as we know it; is temporary. This body is a machine; which is housing the Eternal Soul (the real us) for brief time period. At the time of death the Soul transmigrates from current body to the next body. As the embodied soul continuously passes; in this body; from boyhood to youth to old age; the soul similarly passes into another body at death. A sober person is not bewildered by such a change. (Bhagavad Gita 2.13) Most of us have taken thousands of births in various species of life and on various planets before earning the great gift of Human Life on Earth. If we compare humans with other animals; its easy to see that animals also eat; sleep; have children; defend themselves and sometimes enjoy their lives. But only in the human body we been give the faculty to inquire about the absolute truth via our broad intelligence(big brain) and seven spiritual energy sectors (chakras) in our spine. Therefore; humans are very curious by nature and we want to find out all the secrets of this universe. This is why human life is a great gift because it gives us a chance to know the absolute truth. 3>> Our present body and situation is a direct consequence of our past karma(activities) and desires in this life and previous lifetimes. The laws of this universe are always enacted without failure and hence every action has an equal and opposite reaction. This world is perfect in executing it’s universal laws. Gravity does not have a blackout. The Sun; everyday rises and sets on time; without delay. Hence; the conditioning; restrictions and misery in this temporary body; continues forever; unless one is liberated. 4>> Its very challenging to be able to see things as they really are. This because we are under a strong entanglement of illusion (called maya). The starting point of this illusion is our bodily concept of life; where we consider our body and everything connected with this body (like family; religion; gender; state; nation etc.) as our own. And everything else as separate (or as others). 5>> It is not only very difficult to be happy for a short time in this world. But it’s impossible; to sustain any kind of happiness permanently and to avoid misery in this world. Hence; by any amount of hard work or extreme endeavors; it is impossible to reach a state of complete happiness or satisfaction. 6>> The material world and living entities within it are controlled by external energy of the Supreme God. This external energy (also called Maya); is the bewildering agency; which keeps us engaged in the material world. The external energy conducts itself via three modes of material nature called gunas; viz.goodness (sattva); passion (rajas) and ignorance (tamas). All moving and non-moving things having varying degrees of these modes. And that is how they are being conditioned. 7>> There is one Supreme God. He has an eternal blissful spiritual body. He is the origin of all. He has no other origin and He is the prime cause of all causes. (Brahma Samhita 5.1) 8>> Whenever and wherever there is a decline in religious practice and a predominant rise of irreligion — at that time Supreme Godhead descends himself (incarnates among living beings residing on material planets). (Bhagavad Gita 4.7) Supreme God declares that — To deliver the pious and to annihilate the miscreants; as well as to reestablish the principles of religion; I Myself appear; millennium after millennium. (Bhagavad Gita 4.8) 9>> Depending upon the time and situation; the Supreme God; tunes his incarnation (or avatar) to deliver perfectly; the living beings (who are willing to hear his message) of all miseries and misfortune. This tuning means; that the God does not have to descend on our planet with his full entourage of powers; as only a portion of his powers are sufficient in most millenniums. This means; a plenary portion of Supreme God; takes form of a divine being and lives among the people. 10>> The incarnations of the Lord are innumerable; like rivulets flowing from inexhaustible sources of water. (Srimad Bhagavatam 1.3.26) Over the millenniums; many incarnations of Supreme Godhead have appeared on Earth and hence he is known by many names and forms. These are names and forms (variety of religions) of the plenary portions of God and all of them are bonafide and auspicious. Among many; the couple of principle names of the Supreme God are Krishna and Govinda. All of the above-mentioned incarnations are either plenary portions or portions of the plenary portions of the Lord; but Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa is the original Personality of Godhead. All of them appear on planets whenever there is a disturbance created by the atheists. The Lord incarnates to protect the theists. (Srimad Bhagavatam 1.3.28) 11>> The wonderful; liberating and impossible activities performed by God when he descends on our planet. Not only relieve the burden of evil from the Earth. But also helps man to understand what lies beyond this material world and to believe in transcendental spiritual nature of the world and it’s limitless possibilities. Other than Lord’s personal desire; there is no cause for His appearance; disappearance or activities. As the Supersoul; He knows everything. Consequently there is no cause that affects Him; not even the results of fruitive karmic activities (pious or sinful). (Srimad Bhagavatam 9.24.28) God when he descends on Earth; does not take up a normal material body made of flesh; blood and bones. He is not bounded by laws of material nature. Rather his body is spiritual (or transcendental). Supreme God is cause of all causes; if his transcendental body were not beyond the modes of material nature (gunas); one could not understand the difference between matter and transcendence. Only by his presence can one understand the transcendental nature of Supreme God’s Lordship; who is the controller of material nature. His transcendental nature is very difficult to understand unless one is influenced by the presence of his transcendental form. (Srimad Bhagavatam 10.2.35) Supreme God is cause of all causes; if his transcendental body were not beyond the modes of material nature (gunas); one could not understand the difference between matter and transcendence. Only by his presence can one understand the transcendental nature of Supreme God’s Lordship; who is the controller of material nature. His transcendental nature is very difficult to understand unless one is influenced by the presence of his transcendental form. (Srimad Bhagavatam 10.2.35) These eleven tenants will help in realizing the journey one can take from the mundane and temporary materialism to pure bliss and illumination of spirituality. Utmost Relevance of Spiritual Technology Today In this age most of us feel; the balance of our lives is slightly (or a lot) tipped in the wrong direction. Hence; even fortunate people with health and wealth are meandering around looking for happiness. All they find are; temporary pleasures which are directly or indirectly related to sense gratification. Absence of miseries is falsely considered as happiness. We also develop a deep rooted attachment with people and objects through which we get these temporary pleasures. Attachment also fosters a strong defense mechanism; which totally disregards any idea that suggests that the objects of our attachment may not be worth it (or there could be something much more worthwhile than we have been running after). This helps us to agree; that even amidst the many riches of material comforts and available pleasure or happiness options; there hardly any hope for permanent happiness and sense of complete satisfaction. By nature everyone is ultimately looking for happiness but they are not finding it to their heart’s satisfaction. The reason for this is that we have completely lost touch with our spiritual nature and our soul. The culture and knowledge of spiritual technology which could enable us to reenter the realm of spirituality; has been discarded; degraded and manipulated. There is unbounded happiness viable for anyone who taps into spirituality with sincere efforts. But this is lost on us. This is not only an individual’s self help problem. Rather; it is much more grave and encompassing; as our society; world governments and schools; research and science and our fantasies for future are completely relying on material technology and only looking for material temporary happiness. There is no inclusion of spirituality in any real plan that people actually would execute. Spirituality is often clubbed into either religion or religious sentiment; sense of goodness (charity or philanthropy) or some form physical circus Yoga (or mediation). Religions and religious practices have been marginalized; not paid attention to and in general people have no proper understanding of even their own religion. To conclude; in material world there is no happiness at all. There is just the futile attempt to get rid of the miseries; and temporary cessation of misery is falsely called happiness. Since our education; society; nation or current fashion discards spirituality and there is no hope of finding true happiness with materialism; we are actually doomed in this lifetime. The problem is at a much macro level as we are collectively churning away at materialism with full energy and focus. The best scientists and biggest companies of the world are working to find new sophisticated ways of bringing out more and more of material comfort; pleasure; ease of life and longevity of human life. Hence; the best of the world are only engaged materially. At best; they are engaged in philanthropic activities; which only help to solve relatively smaller problems and their solutions only work for sometime. To date; there is not even a single working solution for grave world problems like mass violence; mass hunger or global warming. Take a moment; and think about this; nobody thus far has a working solution; among; top notch scientific research; engineering endeavors; Nobel prize winners or best philosophers or economists or great governments. The best solutions we have are helping us to just survive and delay the inevitable. They provide a cushion or decrease the amount of misery. They materially enrich and empower a few more humans every year. They provide new profound ways for sense gratification for temporary pleasures. They are nice. But; they aren’t permanently solving any grave world problem by its root cause. They are not providing us with a nurturing society full of happiness and free from all fear. They are not taking us where we need to go. Herein lies the utmost importance of spiritual technology. It will help us open drapes of ignorance and help us experience the missing spiritual bliss which is mind-bogglingly awesome. It can help teach the society as whole on how to live in harmony with nature and with all living beings. It shows the path of how not put our self interest at the center of our lives but how to keep the Supreme God at the center and with that have compassion for all living beings. It is possible to lead a full meaningful and blissful life in this way. Spirituality is the only hope to achieve the real goal of human life. The ultimate possibilities of spirituality attained via appropriate Yoga practice(spiritual technology); is best summarized in four verses of Bhagavad Gita: “In the stage of perfection called trance; or samādhi; one’s mind is completely restrained from material mental activities by practice of Yoga. This perfection is characterized by one’s ability to see the Self by the pure mind and to relish and rejoice in the Self. In that joyous state; one is situated in boundless transcendental happiness; realized through transcendental senses. Established thus; one never departs from the truth; and upon gaining this he thinks there is no greater gain. Being situated in such a position; one is never shaken; even in the midst of greatest difficulty. This indeed is actual freedom from all miseries arising from material contact.” (Bhagavad Gita 6.20–23) As per this description; before we can obtain “boundless transcendental happiness” there are two difficult to overcome prerequisites. Firstly; we must be able to restrain the mind completely from material mental activities. Along the same lines; the revered Yoga Sutras gives a very brief definition of Yoga — “Yoga is the cessation of movements in the consciousness” (Yoga Sutras 1.2). This helps to bring the mind in a pure state of consciousness. Secondly; using this purified mind we must be able to see the Self. In simple terms this means having the awareness that we are actually not this body or mind; but we are the eternal blissful soul. The soul is currently under the covering of this gross body that see and the subtle body made of mind; intelligence and false ego. At the time of death in the present body the soul will transmigrate to another body. The soul is always accompanied in all our (and that of others) past; present and future bodies by the supersoul which is a feature of Supreme personality of Godhead. The supersoul is our best well wisher; and divine portion of God himself. To perceive the soul; the supersoul and the knowledge of soul’s subordinate but divine connection with supersoul and Supreme God is the ability to see the Self. This certainly looks like a pretty tall order. This is similar to a child aspiring to become a neurosurgeon would see the process of actually becoming one as daunting. But; if the child sincerely works with determination through the long arduous process of the medical education (that too neurological); he can certainly become a neurosurgeon. Hence; in Yoga or spirituality as well; one just has to follow the bona-fide process with sincere hard work and determination. And then; all the limitless possibilities of spirituality and reaching the perfect state of trance; become achievable. A well known saying goes — “the change begins with us”. It’s actually very true. Each responsible person must endeavor to become perfect by applying spiritual technology. And the more such people we have in the world the more real positive impact they can make towards emphatically solving all the big problems of the world from their root cause. Breakdown of Spiritual Technology (what is it?) One easy way to understand any technology; is to list down ‘practical components’ compromising the technology. To further the understanding; one then can delve into the ‘interaction between components’ and ‘how they jell together’ to deliver the technology. For example lets look at the automobile manufacturing technology which has been around for 150 years; its pretty mature and advanced. Everyone can relate to cars including children. Most of us can explain (in varying degrees of detail) how they are made and delivered to us? This is my take on it. This technology consists of these practical components; graphical car design; concept car design testing; acquiring of raw material or smaller parts; factory with assembly line to put it all together and finally transportation to send it out to world markets. Its intuitive to visualize how these components interact together and ultimately keep producing and distributing thousands of cars. Repeating this exercise for spiritual technology; here is the list of its practical components: Spiritual practitioners (Yogis) Unadulterated spiritual knowledge (revered ancient scriptures like Bhagavad Gita) Bona-fide human culture and civilization (based on Yogic ideas and principles) Qualified spiritual master (Guru) Pristine Yoga processes (spiritual practices) Unbounded spiritual bliss (and transcendental emotions) The Supreme God (the Goal) These seven components and their interactions; constitute the spiritual technology. Among these; the Supreme God is eternal and ever present. Supreme God is the creator and source of the remaining six components. These spiritual components are the supreme mercy of God and created by him to help the conditioned and suffering living beings to move from material world to spiritual world; in order to experience complete uninterrupted bliss. Spiritual knowledge explains in detail all the components of spiritual technology and how it works. Spirituality gets a great foundation; when there exists a human civilization which is based on spiritual principles. The great Indian civilization that has existed from thousands of years and has always fostered spirituality over material development; is therefore the world headquarters of spirituality(or Yoga). This civilization then produces great spiritual teachers(guru); who are well versed in the science of spirituality and can teach it to aspiring and deserving practitioners; the Yogis. The spiritual master; is a master of one or more Yoga processes and is himself a devout practitioner and he never wavers from spiritual principles. He teaches the Yoga process to his disciples based upon the exact spiritual knowledge he had received from his own spiritual master and by reading revered scriptures under his guidance. The disciples gradually develop into budding Yoga practitioners; become well versed with spiritual knowledge and start tapping into the unbounded spiritual bliss. At this stage they start developing an understanding of Supreme God; his creations; the material illusion and real goal of human life. Slowly; the seed of love for Supreme God germinates and they start experiencing transcendental emotions. Ultimately; steadfast and fully determined Yogis achieve the supreme destination which is the eternal spiritual abode of Supreme God. Yogis who remain unsuccessful in achieving this highest goal are born again in material world; but are well equipped to continue on their spiritual journey. Taking a more broader look and going back to history; its clear that this whole world is working based on spiritual technology. In Bhagavad Gita while describing the science of Yoga(spiritual technology) — “The Personality of Godhead; Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa; said: I instructed this imperishable science of Yoga to the sun-god; Vivasvān; and Vivasvān instructed it to Manu; the father of mankind; and Manu in turn instructed it to Ikṣvāku” (verse 4.1). This is a clear indication that Sun; was instructed in the science of Yoga at the beginning of creation. And hence Sun is a perfect Yogi. Sun is never even a microsecond late in rising or setting; it never falls short of changing seasons and providing just the right amount of energy for sustenance of life on Earth. This spiritual technology was then also taught to the first kings and progenitors in disciplic succession. And hence it is also the basis of human civilization. The basis of this ‘science of Yoga’ or ‘spiritual technology’ is the transcendental knowledge derived from the great Vedic scriptures perfectly preserved from past more than 5000 years. This knowledge is best described in as — “Transcendental knowledge in relation with the Supreme God is knowledge resulting in the complete suspension of the waves and whirlpools of the material modes. Such knowledge is self-satisfying due to its being free from material attachment; and being transcendental it is approved by authorities. Who could fail to be attracted?” (Srimad Bhagavatam 2.3.12) To further substantiate the understanding of this knowledge we look at three types of knowledge as described in Bhagavad Gita (verses 18.20–22). These are based on the three modes of material nature and the best form of knowledge is in mode of goodness and and then it degrades for the other two modes (passion is better than ignorance). Knowledge in mode of Goodness (sattva) — That knowledge by which one undivided spiritual nature is seen in all living entities; though they are divided into innumerable forms; you should understand to be in the mode of goodness. Knowledge in mode of Passion (rajas) — That knowledge by which one sees that in every different body there is a different type of living entity you should understand to be in the mode of passion. Knowledge in mode of Ignorance/Darkness (tamas) — And that knowledge by which one is attached to one kind of work as the all in all; without knowledge of the truth; and which is very meager; is said to be in the mode of darkness. Ultimately; transcendental knowledge is even beyond the mode of goodness and hence called transcendental. This knowledge is the gateway to achieve ultimate perfection (full knowledge; full bliss) in human life. This breakdown of spiritual technology; would have hopefully helped in building a 10;000 feet picture. And makes the reader excited starting his or her own transcendental journey towards spirituality. Sign up to discover human stories that deepen your understanding of the world.

The Dance Between Certifications and Self-Learning as a Technologist,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write The Dance Between Certifications and Self-Learning as a Technologist Rich Stewart · Follow Published in DataDrivenInvestor · 6 min read · Jan 2; 2019 -- I have chosen to own my certifications as a Technologist by paying for every one of them that mattered to me. I never waited for or had a sense of entitlement that my employer should pay for them. Over the past 16 years I have earned an alphabet soup of certifications including PMP; ITIL; CSM; CSPO; CSP; and SPC. Only the ITIL foundation certification was sponsored by a former employer; as they were offering it to all of their IT staff. At specific strategic points in my career I have leveraged my certifications to land key jobs that furthered my career. So; I certainly understand that certifications can help a candidate land a job. With so many candidates applying for positions; often a specific certification on a resume can make the difference between an application being considered or rejected based on specific filters. This can be especially important in certain technology areas where a very challenging certification demonstrates extensive knowledge and experience. Some great examples include the CISSP security certification and the CBAP certification for business analysts. While certifications can play a role in getting considered for a job; many of them demonstrate little more than initiative. For example; consider the two first-level Agile certifications offered by Scrum Alliance: Certified ScrumMaster (CSM) and Certified Scrum Product Owner (CSPO). The CSM is obtained by attending a two-day course (by a Certified Scrum Trainer) and then passing an easy 40-question test. The CSPO is even easier. It is obtained merely by attending a two-day course taught by a Certified Scrum Trainer. Don’t get me wrong. I took both of these courses and they were valuable to me. I have used material from each course; taught by very experienced and respected trainers; in subsequent roles as an Agile practitioner. What I’m saying here is that because certifications such as these don’t require one to already be a practitioner and to demonstrate working knowledge; the value in having them on your resume is that they show you took initiative and invested in yourself. That is a positive and I’m happy to acknowledge that obtaining the CSM helped me land my first full-time Scrum Master role. Having said that; I don’t plan to renew my current certifications or pursue any new ones in the foreseeable future. Photo by Lubo Minar on Unsplash Why? It’s actually pretty simple. I’ve spent the past five years working as an Agile practitioner in the role of Scrum Master and/or Agile Coach. During that time; I’ve gained a wealth of hands-on experience working with Agile teams; Product Owners; and other supporting roles. I’ve delivered extensive training (including the equivalent of the two-day CSM and CSPO courses) internally with my current company; IHS Markit. I’ve also coached many individuals and teams to help them mature in their Agile roles. In short; I’ve gained much more experience than any certification could properly express. But that’s just one of the reasons I am not pursuing more certifications. The other key reason is that I make time for deliberate practice every single week. Deliberate practice refers to highly-concentrated learning; and many successful professionals claim the associated five-hour rule of concentrated learning per week is the key to their success. I am very fortunate because I have a boss who practices and fully supports the five-hour rule for his team. However; while we carve out time for deliberate practice during working hours; our passion for our profession means we also choose to do highly-concentrated learning during non-working hours. As a case in point; I’m writing most of this article on New Year’s Day 2019. And if you don’t think writing is deliberate practice; you need to give it a try. Writing is a great exercise to synthesize prior learnings and to gain new insights. Whether you choose to publish and share your writings with others is secondary. The biggest mistake a professional can make is to not invest in their continued learning. Photo by rawpixel on Unsplash The world is changing at a dazzlingly fast pace and we all know that pace is increasing. So why would anyone choose not to invest in oneself to ensure their skills and knowledge remain current; relevant; and marketable? I can only think of three reasons. 1. A person doesn’t have enough passion for what they do to want to learn more. 2. A person feels their employer owes them the training and therefore they shouldn’t have to invest in themselves with time or money. 3. A person is performing well in their current job and is satisfied with how their career is progressing. Let’s break these down. #1. If you don’t have enough passion for continuous learning; that’s a sure sign you need to consider doing something else. Unfortunately; until you’ve actually found your passion; it’s hard to have the perspective of what it feels like to feel really passionate about something. I managed a traditional project management office for nearly five years before becoming an Agile practitioner. While I was successful; I never felt a real passion in that role. I didn’t spend hours each week building on the baseline of knowledge I gained from earning the Project Management Professional (PMP) certification. If I’d have had the perspective then that I do now; I would have sought alternative career directions much sooner. #2. Entitlement is never a winning formula. Employers invest in their employees to widely varying degrees. Moreover; what employers typically do is pay for some one-time training for select employees. That’s not much better than getting another certification. The real lasting and deep learning comes from deliberate practice. You have to own the negotiation with your manager to get regular time each week for learning. If they are unwilling to do so; that tells you all you need to know about your manager and/or employer. It’s time to invest in yourself with deliberate practice on your own time to find a better manager and/or employer. #3. It’s easy to get comfortable with using specific skills; especially if your employer is happy with the job you’re doing. However; technology evolves very quickly; and chances are if you’re using the same technologies you were using five years ago; your skills are dated. One day you’re likely to wake up and find yourself marginalized at best or laid off at worst. As a technologist; never be satisfied with your level of skill and expertise with the technologies you have mastered. Photo by Ben White on Unsplash If I find myself interviewing for a new job someday as an Agile practitioner and am not offered the job because my certifications aren’t current; how will I respond? I will thank that prospective employer for their candor and will consider myself fortunate for dodging a bullet of joining a company with the wrong mindset. If they value a piece of paper more than demonstrable expertise and experience; they are not a company I’d want to join. Key Takeaways Leverage certifications for specific purposes to further your career at key points. Leverage your ability to reinvent yourself through deliberate practice to further your continual growth and to become a leading technology professional in your field.

Lessons From the Immigrant Hustle: Ronit Avni,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write Lessons From the Immigrant Hustle: Ronit Avni Amine Rahal · Follow 3 min read · Jan 3; 2019 What’s your name; company name; and title? Ronit Avni; Localized Inc.; Founder & CEO. Which country did you emigrate from? Canada; from Montreal. What was the most difficult thing you faced when you arrived in the US? Adjusting from having a recession mentality to an abundance-driven one. I left Quebec which was going through a deep recession that lasted many years and so you had to take whatever job you could find — today that is no longer the case but there were no jobs when I was growing up. In the U.S.; you could be more ambitious and more creative if you set your mind to it; but it required shifting to an abundance mentality that allowed you to dream. What was your very first job? Outside of college where I had a variety of jobs; I worked at the human rights organization; WITNESS.org; because I wanted to fuse documentary filmmaking and human rights work. This was at a time when YouTube didn’t yet exist (nor did digital cameras). WITNESS was the first group to envision the ubiquitous presence of cameras; and their potential for social transformation if held by human rights defenders. Peter Gabriel; the musician; conceived of the idea while traveling to South Africa in the 1980s. I joined in 2000 and got hooked on the role that media and technology could play in effecting change. Why did you choose to become an entrepreneur? (c.f. What triggered you?). It wasn’t a conscious choice at first — I would see a gap; look around to see who was filling it; and if there was someone doing so effectively in ways that interested me professionally or creatively or ethically I would join them (in the case of WITNESS; my first job); and if there wasn’t; I’d endeavor to do so directly. That happened both with my first organization; Just Vision; and again with my company; Localized. How did you raise the money necessary to launch your business? (e.g. did you find an investor? Did you borrow from the bank? Did you save money by working a 9 to 5? Please tell us your story). With my first organization; a media/educational nonprofit; I secured a fellowship that allowed me to then slowly raise philanthropic dollars to build out our team. Our first donation was $2500 and that seemed like a lifeline then. I slept on the floor on a mattress in my office for months and gave up my bedroom to a fellow colleague while we worked on our first film. Slowly the organization built a base of supporters and grew to an international team. We produced films and a news site and grew. In the case of our new company; Localized; it has been a painstaking process of fundraising. First through professional acquaintances who know that our team is true to our word; and now from seasoned investors. It is ongoing as we are still an early-stage company with a mix of angel investors and institutional ones. My co-founder Ariadne Papagapitos and I have done some consulting on the side so we could run lean. Why do you think you have been successful? With a musician parent; you learn creative persistence in the face of financial uncertainty and develop a tolerance for risk. Perhaps some combination of stubbornness; risk tolerance; and the ability to weave between communities and cultures.

Channel Transaction Processing,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write Channel Transaction Processing TrinityProtocol · Follow Published in Trinity Protocol · 2 min read · Jan 2; 2019 216 The channel transaction task comes from the TP (Trinity Off-chain Protocol) message. In order to better understand the message processing flow and working mode of the task; this section starts from the basic characteristics; mutual exclusion; orderliness of state channel transactions; and creates and forms the conventions that the Trinity system needs to follow. These conventions will be a fundamental criterion for the design of the Trinity system architecture. Below are the basic characteristics of state channel transactions: • State channel transactions require one or several mutex to guarantee the synchronization of transactions on both sides; • A transaction with the signature by both parties is a valid transaction (VT); • The trigger condition of the on-going transaction is: the previous transaction is a valid transaction (VT); • Semi-valid transactions (SVT) require re-signature; otherwise channel transactions will be blocked; • The benchmark balance of the n transaction is the channel balance of both parties after the completion of the n-1 transaction; • The n valid transaction and the n+1 transaction are considered to be the same transaction (in the case that the network communication sequence may result in packet loss); • The latest transaction can punish all other transactions (except for the transactions to close channels fast and the previous transaction); • Channel transactions should be aggregatable (to improve the performance and throughput of channel transactions). Simple Mathematical Model of the Channel Transactions: As it is shown in the graph; only one transaction at one time will be acknowledged and performed by both peers. To guarantee the mutually exclusiveness; Trinity observe rules in the following convention: • Two parties of the channel and their respective roles：Founder Peer and Partner Peer； • One transaction has a sole identifier (denoted by nonce)； • Classify channel transactions：special transactions and general transactions； ◦ Special transactions: creating channels (nonce=1) and swift settlement of the transactions in the channel (nonce=0). ◦ General transactions: other transactions (RSMC / HTLC): nonce >= 2. • Founder peer generate a solely identifier and a serial number for every transaction. • Partner peer verify; negotiate and reset the sole identifier. During the transaction; the MCR saves transaction data from both peers into FIFO message list; and the WCR read; verify and sign the transaction before sending it out to the other peer.

From the Deli to Data Science,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write From the Deli to Data Science Joseph Santos · Follow 5 min read · Jan 2; 2019 11 1 All images are non-copyrighted images from Pexels When you grow up you tend to think that anything is possible. When I was 4 my grandmother bought me VHS tapes of Carl Sagan’s Cosmos (dubbed in Spanish). Back then I believed him when he said “…The open road still softly calls; like a nearly forgotten song of childhood.” As I grew older; however; my dreams became more like holograms; visible; yet never truly in reach. Throughout high school my grades slowly declined as I began having terrible panic attacks. I would hide my face in my books; in a primordial cycle of fight or flight with no danger present. It became exhausting and some days I opted to not go to school at all. I distanced myself from my friends and became less and less sure of whether I had a future worth pursuing. I worked in a deli and regardless of how polite or how disciplined I was; I would always be treated as almost a competent human being. I had a boss snap his fingers at me; and while most customers were a delight some customers called me boy or asked “where are you from?” knowing they didn’t want to know which street I lived on. My mother and father came from harsher backgrounds than me; yet they seemed to have turned out fine; My mother went from the ghettos to becoming a Navy veteran who graduated 2nd in her class in Airmen school; and my father went from the ghettos to owning his own house at 21. Me; I hadn’t even graduated college yet and couldn’t even seem to be able to go a few days without panic attacks or feelings of depression. The day my life would change was after a particularly rough attack. I was hiding under my pillow; shaking; the room moving around me. Tears rolling down my cheeks. I looked at the first texts I had sent to the woman I would later make my wife. I told her that I promised her a life of adventure; excitement; and new experiences all the time. I had let her down. But I didn’t feel my usual indifference and sadness. Instead I felt anger. Angry that I always had to decline going to parties with too many people or where there wasn’t an adequate exit strategy. Quitting sports because of dizziness. No. I would no longer run. I would spend the next week on google scholar for hours; looking at research on depression and anxiety. I scoured articles of cures and natural remedies. I began taking Omega-3–6–9 pills; creating a diet plan entirely centered around the reduction of anxiousness; cutting caffeine entirely out of my diet and finding strategies to cope with my illness. I left the trenches and ran out into the front lines. I learned about precision medicine and began reading extensively on this field called machine learning and medical imaging. As I said it in my head; “medical data science” I knew I had found my passion. As I took more of a calculated approach towards fighting depression and anxiety; I began learning how to code; and I noticed that I hadn’t had a panic attack in months. I quickly picked it up and began taking advanced maths and programming courses at my college. My first machine learning course was Andrew NGs course on machine learning From there I would take everything from Coursera; Udemy; Jeremy Howard’s fastai deep learning courses and MIT OpenCourseWare courses to build up the spots where I was lacking. Anything that could get me closer to my new realized dream: a world without mental illness. A smarter; data-driven world. A world without people silently waging mental wars and feeling there are no reinforcements coming. After I felt okay with my coding ability I applied to 10 jobs a week for months and went to a few hackathons. My team ended up winning 2nd place. Things were heating up. It would be after 44 jobs rejecting me with passive statements of “while you stood out; we’ve decided to go with other applicants at this time”; that I would finally get an interview with one company; An engineering insurance company. I was now a data science intern. Wow. This was not like the deli. The developers and engineers drank cocktails with the CEO while their new building addition was completed. I was surrounded by people 10 times smarter than I was yet; they all treated me so well. I felt at home. It didn’t matter where I was from or that I was an intern and not a permanent employee. Reflecting on everything; going from a deli in a small town to a data science position in a large city; I realized that the most dangerous place to be is not the streets or untraveled avenues. Those are all the resources you have. The most dangerous place is in your comfort zone. Not being challenged is worse than being the worst in your field. Anything worth doing is worth doing poorly until you can achieve mastery and do it perfectly. If you don’t start; however; then you’ll never know. I also learned that depression is the largest exclusive club there is. Everyone feels like they’re the only one when in reality there are millions of people going through the same thing as you and I. There is greatness in all of us and we all have something to give; to our country; our community; and to our field. All we have to do is start and not listen to those that tell us we aren’t capable.

2019 Intentions: A Social Media Diet and Increased Socially Conscious Entrepreneurship,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write 2019 Intentions: A Social Media Diet and Increased Socially Conscious Entrepreneurship Corey Coto · Follow Published in DataDrivenInvestor · 3 min read · Jan 2; 2019 268 Canggu; Bali — November 2018 by Corey Coto Extremes are unhealthy because it creates unbalance and a lack of harmony in our body and mind. The real purpose of any diet is to give the practitioner a program to help them achieve balance and harmony in their life. A diet is so much more than what foods we put into our bodies it also encompasses the quality of information that we feed our mind. My Cuban Abuelita used to tell me and my sisters as children that we were either too “flacko” or “gordo.” Life is full of ups and downs like our weight. We will experience highs and low as we follow our programs and work to achieve our goals in 2019; but the determination to pick ourselves up when we fall is essential for achieving success. My goal in 2019 is to remain moderate in my use of social media and to start socially conscious businesses that as Marc Benioff says; create a positive impact in the world. In early 2016 and after much internal debate; I decided to delete my Facebook account and have never looked back. Deleting Facebook; while extreme; did not cause me to become a complete technology recluse but provided a significant social media creative constraint and enabled me to be more conscious and intentional with how I use platforms like Instagram; LinkedIn; Twitter; Yelp; and others. Quitting all social media for good is an extreme and unbalanced action. It is much better to learn how to practice moderation in our use of social media as it is a more sustainable path. We are living during the most significant technological revolution in human memory. Artificial Intelligence algorithms designed by a small group of very smart professions are affecting the lives of billions of people around the world. I believe that it is time for more voices from underrepresented groups in technology to be heard. For example; when I was writing the word ‘gordo’ on my iPhone; the Google Keyboard app autocorrected the word to Gordon. I don’t know anyone named Gordon in my community so why would Google AI leaders think ‘gordo’ was a typo for ‘Gordon’ if it wasn’t because for their algorithms are written by a group of mostly white men. Over the coming weeks; I plan to create two Public Benefit Corporations for new businesses that I have started using Gust Launch and Stripe Atlas which are the leading platforms for launching startups used by Silicon Valley entrepreneurs. The first is a socially conscious business with my wife called Minht & Honey; and the other is an artificial intelligence business with a mission to create and promote trust on the Internet called Believability AI. I invite you to follow me on my journey starting here; and I ask all of you to consider going on a social media diet in 2019. Please let me know if you do and share your program.

The Reality of Streaming Sports in Real Time,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write The Reality of Streaming Sports in Real Time Kathryn Kuchefski · Follow Published in Instant Sponsor · 4 min read · Jan 2; 2019 5 We have all been there; Live-Streaming Sunday Night’s big game from our computer or smartphone and BOOM…we receive a text from a friend or social media alert about the big play that just happened. The only problem is; we are watching on an online platform; and our feed is on a 30-second delay… this leads to major spoiler alerts. Ugh. These inherent delays cause viewers to shy away from watching the big game on their computer or smartphone. Not only does this latency lead to poor viewing quality; but also the potential loss of consumers viewing content and sponsorships associated with the big game. This past year; Limelight Networks did a series of surveys exploring consumer opinions; insights; and behaviors surrounding digital content. How do individuals feel about the inherent delays in “Live-Streamed” Sporting Events? And the amazing thing is 59.3% of individuals globally still subscribe to one or more Streaming Video on Demand (SVOD) service. Individuals want the ability to watch their favorite team play; no matter the time or the place. With the growth of social media; it is essential for media outlets to understand the needs and wants of these consumers. Would they be more likely to subscribe to an online platform such as Twitch; Facebook Watch; Reddit; etc. if latency issues were fixed? Source And the overwhelming answer was yes. 59.5% of people said they would be more likely to watch live sports online if the streaming event had no delay from the live broadcast. And more than 65% of individuals 26–45 years of age would stream more sports online if the coverage was not delayed. Source What Exactly Is Live-Streaming? The idea behind live-streaming is that when someone is streaming a sporting event on their device; they are using LTE (Long-Term Evolution); WiFi and Bluetooth. Broadcasters will pick-up signals from their device — a phone — which is called the edge and then pass it along to another edge (phone). This is called Edge-to-Edge transfer — carrier to my phone. And all carriers will communicate differently. Limelight Networks has worked to address this challenge having recently launched Limelight Real-time Video Streaming. The company is claiming their new technology will allow for a sub-second live streaming platform which enables organizations to live stream video from around the world in less than a second. However; the jury is still out on the validity of this new technology. So; stay tuned for more. How Can Live-Streaming Enhance Their Entire Sports Marketplace? Regarding viewing live sports and eSports; the goal of any online streaming company is to make the viewing experience more interactive and therefore more social. Broadcasters could potentially start to communicate with fans during the game through social media and live streams depending on the platform — this has been done before but not in real time. Think of it like an Instagram influencer communicating with fans via Instagram Live. Such capabilities will enable further opportunities for streaming companies to monetize their live video content. 60% of viewers would be more inclined to watch live sports online if they were streamed in real time. Distributors of live video and sports broadcasters need real-time live-streaming sub-second latency coverage to ensure an optimal viewing experience. The enhanced experience will not only increase viewership but also revenue. How Sponsorship will Play a Role With more eyeballs on the ‘big game’; sponsorship should become even sought after. At this moment in time; there is a surplus in sports sponsorship inventory (signage at games; jersey patches; etc). Between 30–50% of sponsorship inventory can go unsold in a given season; depending on the circumstances around the rights holder. Instant Sponsor aims to improve the rights holders ability to sell their inventory; and at the same time allow for a more diverse group of sponsors to enter the sports marketing ecosystem. With sponsorship’s value increased due to living streaming; more brands will be seeking to sponsor teams and athletes. Instant Sponsors platform breaks down the barriers of entry and allows for the parties to interact seamlessly on a peer-2-peer network.

It’s not VoiceOver…It’s EarOver.,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write It’s not VoiceOver…It’s EarOver. Ed Cunningham · Follow 5 min read · Jan 3; 2019 126 To headphone or not to headphone. That is the question. Whether tis nobler in the mind to suffer the tangly mess that is the Sony MDR-7506 headphones; or take to take arms against a sea of aural self-indulgence; and by opposing; ditch the cans. If you’re new to voice over; you may have to get used to hearing yourself through headphones as you speak. This is tricky for some. It will often make beginners slow down and lose their natural talking rhythm; they’ll read in a one-word-at-a-time fashion; rather than read ahead and speak in phrases. Why doesn’t this happen to all voice actors who wear headphones? Their ear is above average. Not the cartilagey parts on the outside; best demonstrated by Alfred E. Newman. I’m talking about the intricate; delicate; hairy parts on the inside. People who master the art of voiceover have “a good ear” above all else. My first agent in Los Angeles was Steve Tisherman. A genius in many respects; he was the agent who developed and subsequently managed the talents of voiceover titan Don LaFontaine. You may remember Don’s gravelly voice serving up the words “In a World” a few thousand times in the 90s and 2000s; yes? Steve Tisherman said to me in our very first meeting; “You want to whisper your way to million bucks? It’s not voiceover. It’s earover.” Earover? That’s not very catchy; Steve. But; what can I say; I was 29 at the time and had no idea what the hell this Hollywood agent was saying to me. Who did he think he was talking to!? I was an actor. I had MFA training! I’d completed Arthur Lessac’s Kinesensic Training for the voice! I played Hamlet at Cambridge! (Or rather; Marc Antony at Chicago Shakepeare!) Who does this agent think he is; telling me how to perform narration? Fast forward sndfgsnjxh years… and yeah…I now understand the brilliance of Steve Tisherman. It IS earover; not voiceover. And the sooner you come to understand this; the sooner you’re on your way to that million bucks. “So…” you ask; “How do I develop a ‘good ear?’” The good news is; you probably already have one. In fact; you probably have two. The bad news is; you must be a consumer in the market that you wish to participate in. And if that’s commercial voiceover; then yes; you must listen to commercials. Lots of them. Don’t watch them. Listen to them. Close your eyes; and listen to the voiceover; as well as the music and sound effects. Do this for five minutes each day on ispot.tv. Or; if you have an audition; prepare for it by watching that advertiser’s campaigns. What kind of voice did they hire most recently? Do the specs on your copy match the characteristics of the voice they used last; or are they trying to go in a different direction? Make it your business to participate in your business. If you’re interested in narrating audiobooks; start listening to narrators who possess similar vocal characteristics to your own. “She sounds sorta like me” is a eureka moment in the world of audiobook narration. Study her phrasing; her baseline intonation; her characterizations when reading dialogue. Pull up the voice recorder app on your phone; and repeat a paragraph that your vocal doppleganger has just read. (Audiobook narrators speak in paragraphs; not sentences. Try one on for size!) Now; play it back. Compare your read to her read. Now do it again; and see if you can somehow make your read better. This little exercise will help you groove your style; your pace; your breathing; your delivery. And it has nothing to do with your voice; but everything to do with your ear. Here’s another tip that a voiceover coach gave me when I was first starting out: If you’re going to inflect your voice; do it in half steps instead of whole steps. Think in terms of a piano keyboard — if you’re going to inflect upward with your voice; go from a C to C#; rather than a C to a D. Take for instance; the line “How are you today?” The writer of the brilliant line has made it clear in the specs that he needs a happy; energetic voice for this particular piece of copy. To most actors; that means there’s a good chance you’ll inflect your voice up and down in a more dynamic way than you would normally. Don’t do it! The writer’s direction is sometimes useful; but more often than not it’s a trap! (And we all fall for it.) Try saying “How are you today?” as if you’re talking to your significant other at six in the morning before you’ve had coffee. Keep it flat. Keep it decaffeinated. Say it a couple of times. Record it. Listen back. Then; return to your microphone and try again; this time putting just a smidge of inflection back in. But do it half-heartedly. Or rather; in “half steps.” Now; do it again; and forget the entire exercise. Just “throw the line away” as voice directors like to say. All of this work is to train your ear. Not your voice. Of course; there are non-believers amongst us. Many casting directors in L.A. will often NOT have headphones in their recording booths. They’ll tell you; “Actors listen to themselves too much. I want a natural read; so no headphones.” But let me tell you; it’s jarring for many actors who are used to working with headphones to suddenly not have them. And while there may be some truth to headphones creating problems for the newcomer; every seasoned pro I know disagrees with these casting directors; but we adapt and make do. (That is our job ultimately.) It’s the casting director who misses out; because the seasoned pro has developed an ear; and they use that ear to produce narration that breathes life into a script and onto a screen in a way that people without a trained ear cannot. Singers use in-ear monitors when they sing. Why? Because their ear and their voice have become one and the same. If it truly bothers you to hear your own voice amplified while you’re reading; then ditch the cans! You can still develop a sharp ear without them. Just know that you may have to wear them one day at a job when you’re being directed by someone in another city. They’ll be on the phone; but somehow; magically; they’ll be speaking to you through your headphones. Many VO actors employ the one-on-one-off method for wearing headphones; where you slide one of the cans off your ear toward the back of your head. It’s a compromise that; hopefully; more casting directors will be open to in 2019. After all; this is earover we’re talking about.

How To Get Ready For The Age of Digital Companionship.,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write How To Get Ready For The Age of Digital Companionship. Samuel Carlton · Follow Published in DataDrivenInvestor · 6 min read · Jan 2; 2019 1 Just make sure you plug them in. “Falling in love is a crazy thing to do. It’s kind of like a form of socially acceptable insanity.” — Her (2013). Getting Closer to the Slippery Slope. — In the 21st Century dating scene; many singles are longing for ‘a deeper connection’ in addition to finding chemistry with ‘the right one.’ With the advent of apps such as Tinder or Bumble; it can seem even easier — or harder; depending on who you talk to — to find that special someone worth sharing your life with. What used to be a process relegated for matchmakers; mixers; and clubs everywhere is now harnessed in the internet’s potential. No longer do you have to leave your home to find somebody special — you can scroll through an online marketplace of people on your phone; tablet or computer. One of my previous articles dictated how this has changed the dating game… ( …But it remained mum on the inevitable consequences artificial-intelligence will cause to human-relationships everywhere). A quick scroll through search engines reveals where we’re at already. In places like Japan — which is already experiencing historically low marriage and birthrates due to several socioeconomic factors; middle-aged-men can be rented to act not only as private confidants but to perform tasks involving advice or listen to troubles ailing clients. Services like these can deter the stress friends and family members bring into life’s fray — especially if questions involving romance pop up. There are already services in the United States where artificial-intelligence can take care of older demographics but when it comes to romance and companionship; many modern video games can allow the player character to couple with eligible bachelors or bachelorettes over the course of the game (the space-opera Mass Effect; the farming-simulation Harvest Moon; or even the high-fantasy Elder Scrolls series are notorious for having these features). Even if romance isn’t the main objective of the game; it’s at least offered to make the virtual world seem more…human…than it normally would be. But…what if romance is an interactive medium’s main objective? “Oh; I see. You don’t like real girls.” — Blade Runner 2049 (2017). The Desire for the ‘Perfect Mate.’ — N obody’s perfect. While people tend to search for a mate that’s going to be compatible in personality; goals; and desired looks; websites and apps are already helping people scale down to a niche that defines exactly what their preference is. Even in spite of this; online-dating is never a sure thing. If there is a demographic surplus of eligible people; some may be left out in the cold. To illustrate this; an entire industry has arisen in places such as China to help the overflow of single men connect with a relationship. If suitable mates are in short supply; something has to give. Popular culture has been touching on the idea of a virtual mate ever since complex programming became a mainstream idea. Relatively early works such as Philip K. Dick’s Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep (1968) and Isaac Asimov’s Forward the Foundation (1993) all contain the exploration of romance between human and non-human. Today; films such as Her (2013); Ex Machina (2015); Blade Runner: 2049 (2017) — the film being a sequel to the first adaptation of the aforementioned Electric Sheep; and TV shows like Black Mirror (with episodes such as ‘Be Right Back’ (2013) and ‘Hang the DJ’ (2017) or Westworld (2016 — ) all playing or toying with the idea of what a romance between a human and a machine would look like… …assuming it’s even possible. How convincing a digital creation is can lead to some never letting go. The biggest appeal for a virtual companion is the ability for the user to design one that fits their schedule; needs; and personality. Instead of having to work out date nights or go through a bad relationship; many are leaving software-engineers to do the dirty work for them. This is leading to games and apps moving past the standard ‘dating-sim’ style of game and into ones where the goal is to reach a virtual ongoing relationship. Why bother searching for the real thing when a virtual one is already programmed for you? Although some may see games like these as harmless fun; it may not help for those who already struggle with unrealistic expectations for their love life. While professing your love for an artificial-intelligence may be something that only those dismissed as ‘loners;’ ‘freaks;’ or ‘weirdo’s’ may have to contend with. It’s also surprising considering just how many people have already used such games or services without a second thought. One industry that isn’t backing down is the sex industry. If relationships between man-and-machine may be murky waters not many want to tread; many are already jumping right into the pool of how robots could change the need for old-fashioned ‘relations…’ “When you are thirteen; you spend all your time imagining what it would be like to live in a world where you could pay a robot for sex. And that sex would cost a dollar. And the only obstacle to getting that sex would be making sure you had four quarters…” — Charles Yu; How to Live Safely Inside a Science-Fictional Universe. The Desire for the ‘Perfect Mold.’ — C ompanies and developers engaged in the art of programming sex-bots are continuing on an upward trajectory to make them not only programmable but more realistic. The world of sex-robots has emerged from private novelties into an industry that might invade not only brothels but even Amsterdam’s Red Light District. With sex tourism changing; the use of virtual companions instead of real ones could do anything from preventing the spread of STD’s to cutting down on human trafficking. What sounds like a hard pitch is instead developing into the preferred road for those involved in managing such trades. If this eventually develops into a norm; then the question of whether this is a form of cheating arises. The more that robots are programmed to look; think; and feel like humans; then the more one needs to talk with their real-life-relationships about how they think and feel about this notion. Let alone any talk of how-far-is-too-far in terms of AI programming; a question some couples may have to face is how they’d react to being caught with a bot. If the robots aren’t even used as a real-life substitute but just something ‘for fun’ or ‘novelty;’ should it be considered a new social norm? “…then you grow up and it turns out you do live in that kind of world. A world with coin-operated sexbots. And it’s not really as great as you thought it would be.” — Charles Yu; How to Live Safely Inside a Science-Fiction Universe. How Will You Face the Future? — R egardless of how prevalence digital companionship becomes in the decades to come; there are two big questions we must ask ourselves. 1. Are we willing to tolerate the notion that others may find satisfying relationships with digital companions? 2. Are we willing to accept the fact that we might do the same? It may be evident that certain personality types are drawn to digital companionship over real ones. Regardless of how real the romance is engineered; for those not already sent down the rabbit hole of obtaining the ‘perfect mate;’ there will be little doubt you may come across a friend or family member who ends up choosing this direction or dabbling in what it offers.

State Of Autonomy: December Recap,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write Member-only story State Of Autonomy: December Recap Mitch Turck · Follow 2 min read · Jan 3; 2019 15 1 User interface for Waymo One passengers Every month; I recap the news articles I’ve consumed around autonomous vehicles; calling out the highlights and keeping track of market progress. This is also your chance to nominate a topic for discussion next month. December was a remarkably light news month; but our wonderful media outlets came to the rescue by Frankensteining together a batch of “2018 recap” articles; most of which exclaimed that autonomous tech had faltered during the past year by highlighting the death of Elaine Herzberg and then tossing in some garbage material as filler. The sentiment is pretty far from the truth; but we know the public prefers stories over facts and logic; so that’s what you get from publications that get paid to grab you by the eyeballs. As a counterpoint; I’ll offer a brief recap of my year’s more notable editorials. May you go into 2019 a wiser person; or at least riddled with self-doubt: Why It’s So Difficult To Compare Man And Machine Why There Is No Clear Distinction Between Conventional Cars And Autonomous Cars Why Self-Driving Vehicles Won’t Outperform Humans Why Driverless Cars Don’t Need To Prevent A Single Crash This Month’s Highlights: Federal Legislation (AV START Act) Stalls Out In Congress Denso Is Latest OEM Supplier To Announce Division Of AV & EV Business From Traditional Operations Zoox Is First To Gain California’s Approval For Operating A Commercial Self-Driving Service Uber Creates Stricter Testing Limitations And Receives Approval To Resume Testing In Pennsylvania Uber Hires NHTSA Official To Keep Vigil Over Its AV Program A Roundup Of Contracts & Costs Involving Public Driverless Vehicle Tests California Highway Patrol Vehicles Successfully Stop An Autopilot Tesla While Driver Is Sleeping Commercializations: May Mobility continues to launch public shuttles around the Rust Belt; this time in Columbus; OH.

Barney’s Talk · Follow 8 min read · Jan 2; 2019 327 七個生活中的區塊鏈落地應用 很多人都說 2018 年是區塊鏈商用化的元年，回顧過去一年，無論是金融界、醫療界、創業圈、娛樂圈、學術圈，都在討論同一件事：區塊鏈。在技術演進近十年後，現在正是區塊鏈在產業落地的轉捩點，不論技術面或應用面的創新都讓人引頸期盼，今天我們就來介紹七個改變人類生活的區塊鏈應用。 Everledger 衝突鑽石的解方，更有效的維持金伯利進程 Everledger結合了區塊鏈、物聯網、AI打造珠寶追蹤平台。如果全球多數的鑽石交易可以使用區塊鏈作為交易標準，則這些鑽石交易就變得可以合理追蹤，由於區塊鏈的特色之一即為去中心化與不得竄改，交易雙方認證的有效性不再交給某個中央組織去負責運作，且所有交易所需的原石來源、估值等都能因區塊鏈技術平台的引入，而能同時得到多方認可，能夠真正有效執行 金伯利進程（Kimberley Process）。 Everledger 透過引入 IBM Blockchain 的解決方案，以資訊科技（區塊鏈）取代全球原本使用紙本文件往來，緩不濟急且容易遭到竄改、偽造所有權、假鑽偽冒或多次驗證而瀕臨破碎的金伯利進程（Kimberley Process）。 金伯利進程（Kimberley Process）: 是指對毛胚鑽石進出口貿易所實施的一項監管制度，其目的是為了根除非洲血鑽石的非法貿易，維護非洲地區的和平與穩定。 HalalChain 清真認證(Halal Certification)的商品溯源 全世界約有20億的穆斯林，日常生活中不論食品、用品都必須符合清真認證。 杜拜的區塊鏈新創HalalChain看見了這項需求，HalalChain可以通過對生產、加工和分銷的各個階段跟踪來驗證清真食品、藥品和化妝品等整個供應鏈。該系統將通過實時監測、全面應用清真標準以及有效實現清真認證，從而徹底完善清真合規行為的完整性。 然而，HalalChain的使用不僅僅局限於清真產業，它還可以用於提高食品標籤要求的透明度，如有機食品、非轉基因和無穀蛋白食品等等。 奧丁丁 不再為重複訂房所苦，解決住房管理痛點 以往住宿業者在各大訂房網站上刊登房源以增加曝光率，但是同時也造成了超賣或是重複訂房的風險，奧丁丁推出OwlNest區塊鏈旅宿管理服務，提供一套支援智能合約的飯店管理PMS系統，也可串接大型訂房服務。業者還可以設定智能合約，來設定促銷方案、庫存管理。OwlNest利用以太坊（Ethereum）的智能合約（Smart Contract）來定義商業邏輯，並將資料寫入以太坊的私有鏈，訂單進來，就可以立刻透過區塊鏈知道是否有房，避免超賣問題。 DTCO 電子病歷完善化，隱私及可攜性大升級 Create an account to read the full story.

RPA and the Future of Work,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write RPA and the Future of Work Rob King · Follow Published in DataDrivenInvestor · 3 min read · Jan 2; 2019 12 1 There is seemingly a contradiction around the impact RPA is having on people and jobs. On one hand; you have the claims that by solution providers that jobs are not being lost; while other industry commentators claim that the benefits cannot be achieved without loss of jobs. What is the truth of the situation? Can they both be correct? Is it possible both scenarios are actually correct and not entirely contradictory? Let’s start with the optimistic view that automation simply eliminates the mundane tasks and provides the opportunity for more creative; complex and challenging new opportunities. This is explicitly describing that the nature of work will be changing. This is nothing new; in my experience; the advances in technology have been changing my job throughout my entire career. Furthermore; both in the USA and UK the current levels of unemployment are at the lowest we’ve seen for decades. Japan faces an even more challenging situation where the population is in decline and therefore even filling existing roles as workers retire is an impossible task. At this early stage of development; the evidence points to RPA not having a significant impact on job losses. That’s not to say there are no winners and losers in this equation; as some industries clearly find themselves in a situation where their survival depends on cutting costs; staff and buildings being the top two savings opportunities. Let’s look at the pessimistic view that millions of jobs will be lost through automation. These predictions often qualify their statements with two important caveats: the first being that they are existing jobs; the second is the long timeframe for these predictions. Accepting these two caveats; these statements — as far as any predictions of the future can be — are likely also true. the think tank Centre for London warned that almost one-third of jobs in London have high potential to be carried out by machines within the next 20 years What happens in the middle years is interesting. Since most predictions talk in 15-year timeframes; let’s look back at how work has changed since 2004: Facebook has just rolled out to a few college students. By 2017 it’s income had reached $40 Billion. Not to mention that social media generally now has 3 billion active users. iPod was THE gadget to own. It was the start of a whole new way of consuming music; that has advanced to streaming. Music streaming now accounts for 75% of music industry revenue and is worth nearly $4 Billion. Mobile phone innovation was the flip handset. iPhone and Android and the smartphone revolution were still a few years away. Today the smartphone market is considered to be worth $355 Billion! Add to that the spending on the Google and Apple App Stores is thought to be in the region of $40 Billion. Netflix had reached 1 million subscribers but was still a few years away from launching its streaming service. Today it has 137 million subscribers and an income of $11 Billion. The purpose of these examples is simply to demonstrate how much can happen in 15 years and while old jobs will certainly decline; new jobs will be created. Both pessimistic and optimistic statements about the impact of RPA are true; and in the middle new jobs we can only guess about will appear. My personal view is optimistic that the net impact of automation will not result in a loss of jobs but we will see the breadth of jobs change as radically as we have experienced in the last 15 years.

Understanding Your Customer’s Experience: Are You in Orbit or Just Flying By?,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write Understanding Your Customer’s Experience: Are You in Orbit or Just Flying By? James Marland · Follow Published in SAP Innovation Spotlight · 4 min read · Jan 2; 2019 -- New Horizons fly-by of Ultima Thule; Jan 1 2019 © NASA The experience economy dictates that we get to know our customers intimately; not just execute a “fly-by”. We’ve all been transfixed by the amazing precision of the New Horizons spacecraft in locating an object the size of Manhattan 4 Billion miles away. Even more staggering is the fact that it is a one-shot deal; a fly-by which can never be repeated. Osiris Rex entering orbit of Asteroid Bennu. Picture Credit: Heather Roper/University of Arizona But this week saw another spacecraft in final maneuvers: Osiris-Rex went into orbit around an asteroid where it will spend a leisurely two years in orbit. The spacecraft will take high-resolution images of every square inch of the asteroid. During the summer of 2020; the spacecraft will briefly touch the surface to retrieve a sample and is scheduled to deliver the sample to Earth in September 2023. This got me thinking about the way that companies engage with their customers in the Experience Economy. Are you executing a fly-by; or really getting into a close orbit with your customers? The Fly-by Approach Most companies engage with their customers just once; at the point of sale. Perhaps through a simple survey which in a follow-up email; which most customers ignore — I know I do. A more sophisticated approach may be through a loyalty card program; but that tends to focus on just the transnational nature of the interaction. What did the customer buy; how much did they pay. Neither of these approaches allow the deeper questions to be asked; such as — “Why did the customer buy?” — “How did we do in meeting their expectations?” — “How could we improve?” These questions remain unasked and unanswered. It’s as though a New Horizons scientist; after seeing an image of the surface of the rock; asks “can we zoom is a bit closer”? No; you can’t: the spacecraft is already millions of miles away. In the same way; a Customer Service Manager can’t ask a follow-up question such as “Did Mrs Jones bring her husband to the store that day?” Mrs Jones has left the building and is now miles away. The Close Orbit The mission planners on Osiris Rex had the luxury of a much closer object; shorter radio lag and more fuel; so they could design their mission very differently. Different orbital trajectories can be programmed as the scientists learn more about the asteroid; every angle will be photographed; conflicting data can be corrected. This is the type of close relationship that companies need with their ever more demanding and fickle consumers; yet at the same time balancing that with their concerns about privacy and their desire that brands that they engage with should “not be creepy”. Osiris Rex had a very different mission profile than New Horizons; which had a trajectory built for speed and distance. It didn’t have the fuel to stop and get into orbit with Pluto; Charon and other bodies as it zoomed past. NASA had to make a trade-off between the two approaches. The Experience Economy In the Experience Economy; it’s not just about what you know; but your ability to act on that insight with confidence and speed. Think about ways that companies try to understand their customers; suppliers or employees. Most tools show broad feedback but lack precision and speed. The timely process of surveys and manual feedback collection can take months to collect and analyze data. By the time decisions are made and products fixed; it is too late. It can feel like a scientist staring wistfully at New Horizons receding into the distance wishing “if only I had asked that question a bit differently”. At SAP we believe the next evolution of enterprise applications has begun with a real-time connection between the system of action and the system of record. You need both the trajectory to visit all of your customers; yet at the same time the ability to develop deep relations with them so you can deliver the experience they want. No longer do companies have to make a choice between the fly-by and the close orbit.

One way to eliminate these disparities and surface better solutions is through early adoption of health technology outside of the hospital to some of the poorest Americans. This is one of the many reasons we will be hosting a half-day open innovation event in San Francisco this week. The Open Innovation in Healthcare Pop-Up will feature a curated list of attendees ranging from startups to enterprises and investors. Solving tomorrow’s healthcare challenges requires today’s preeminent organizations to interface with healthcare systems in ways that they haven’t needed to in the past. The event will be hosted in partnership with Ogilvy Consulting and Mount Sinai Co-Lab as they both have the desire to transform; innovate and find solutions to healthcare challenges that have the potential to impact health globally. Together; we have convened practitioners from across the healthcare ecosystem to discuss how they overcome key challenges of making innovation work in their organizations.

Top Challenges to Successful IoT Initiatives — And How to Overcome Them,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write Top Challenges to Successful IoT Initiatives — And How to Overcome Them Calum McClelland · Follow Published in IoT For All · 4 min read · Jan 2; 2019 41 Image Credit: IoT For All In the past few years that I’ve spent in the IoT industry; helping to develop; deploy; and improve IoT solutions involving millions of sensors; I’ve learned that often the biggest hurdles to success aren’t technological. A Gartner study last year found that only 26 percent of surveyed companies were successful with their IoT initiatives. This is an abysmal statistic; but it doesn’t surprise me given the many I’ve personally seen — many of which are purely operational or organizational. Although many issues associated with #IoT deployments aren’t technological; they’re equally painful and difficult to overcome. || #IoTForAll @Leverege Click To Tweet Although many issues associated with IoT deployments aren’t technological; they’re equally painful and difficult to overcome. And if every organization has to overcome these challenges in a void; a 74 percent failure rate is likely to continue. But here at Leverege; we believe in openly sharing the knowledge and insights that we’ve gained through our extensive experience; because it’s this open sharing of knowledge that will help us all to move forward together; collectively amplifying our human potential. So in this series; I’ll be exploring the issues we’ve seen; with examples taken from our experiences; and how you can overcome similar challenges as you pursue your own IoT initiatives. Whether you’re a solutions provider building new solutions for clients; or you’re one of the organizations integrating IoT technologies into your current systems and processes; I hope this series of posts will equip you with knowledge and strategies that will help you to succeed. If you’re relatively new to IoT and the various technologies and terminologies associated with it; I encourage you first to read the Intro to IoT eBook I wrote. This is a comprehensive (but simple!) introduction to and explanation of many important concepts that I’ll assume readers know as I explore various challenges.  I’ll save the in-depth exploration for future posts; but here are just a few of the topics to come: You Need to Associate We’re increasingly using sensors and devices to allow us to represent physical objects and their attributes digitally. For example; in asset tracking applications; you’ll likely have a tracker that’s attached to a given asset you’d like to track. The asset is the thing we want to track; but the tracker is the thing that’s capturing and sending data. Therefore; you need to know that this tracker is on this asset; which we call “association” or “pairing.” For most asset tracking applications; someone needs to manually associate a tracker to a given asset; and when you introduce a manual step; there are bound to be problems. From labeling issues during manufacturing to operational issues like employees simply not associating trackers to the assets; I’ll share some of the challenges we’ve faced with IoT Association and how you can avoid or overcome them. Little Changes Are Big Changes in IoT Initiatives The Internet of Things is often called “a system of systems;” and with good reason: successful IoT initiatives usually involve a combination of hardware; software; and connectivity; which is then tied into business processes and operations. Because of the complexity and systemic codependence; a simple change in one part of the system — or subsystem — can effectively break the entire system of systems. Let’s say that you want to make some changes to the firmware on your sensor/device to help reduce the battery drain; so you reduce the number of messages sent from the sensor/device per day. Great! You’ve just added on a few months of battery life! But unbeknownst to you; your IoT system uses the number of messages from the sensors/devices to flag when a sensor/device may be defective. After making this change; you suddenly have countless sensors/devices being flagged by the system as defective; which at best hurts user confidence and at worst means that the system itself doesn’t work (e.g. if defective sensors/devices are automatically prevented from being used). Although this challenge effectively boils down to good communication; this can be difficult within a single organization — let alone across the multiple organizations and partnerships that IoT initiatives often require to be successful. In this future post; I’ll share some examples to demonstrate how seriously you should take even the little changes. I’ll also offer some strategies for effectively communicating and managing these changes. What Challenges Are You Facing? I have plenty more topics in mind that I’ll be covering after the above two posts; but this series is ultimately meant to be helpful to you; the reader! So if there’s a particular challenge that you’re facing or that you’d like me to explore; please let me know and I’ll make sure to prioritize it. Just put your thoughts in the “How can we help?” field. Originally published at www.iotforall.com on January 2; 2019. Sign up to discover human stories that deepen your understanding of the world.

Invest Less to Innovate More,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write Check your assumptions about the costs of innovation Invest Less to Innovate More Mark Mader · Follow Published in Smartsheet News · 4 min read · Jan 3; 2019 14 Generating ideas from insights that improve a business; or create value for its customers; might be the most important thing your business does. Such innovation makes an organization more competitive and more efficient; often translating to more success and bigger profits; or in other cases — survival. Investing in those ideas comes at a cost; of course; including the risk that failure could leave you in a worse position than had you done nothing at all. Fortunately; advances in technology aimed at empowering business users have fundamentally redefined what’s achievable and; at the same time; has improved the probability weighted outcomes of business improvement initiatives. As a result; the assumptions that business leaders have traditionally used to calculate the costs of innovation — whether “back-of-the-napkin” or comprehensive models — are no longer valid. In fact; I contend that the “risk” of innovation has never been lower. When business leaders have evaluated “innovation” opportunities for things such as process improvement; deeper customer engagement; or enhanced decisioning; they’ve generally considered six factors: Potential benefits; financial or otherwise Financial capital required to fund project Human capital required to deliver project Opportunity cost of pursuit Time required to realize benefit Risk of partial realization or outright failure But by reducing three key factors — cost; time; and resources required — business user driven work management technologies can also minimize the risk of outright failure. That means business leaders should recalibrate their assumptions about technology-based investment decisions; by increasing the probability of success. Higher probabilities combined with higher throughput of projects executed upon; can result in superior overall returns. Technology unleashes the power of innovation The driver is the ongoing infusion of technology tools; which has reduced real and perceived costs which were previously assumed to be too high to justify an initiative or process improvement. These tools include a range of work execution applications and services; and the automation and integration of work processes that wasn’t easily attainable just a few years ago. Those technologies make many ideas and innovations feasible without the costs traditionally associated with calling in scores of consultants or trying to climb up the consideration list of heavily taxed IT departments. This enables waves of new experimentation — more quickly and with less risk. Projects that used to take years or months to mobilize; can now take months or weeks; including change management and training — a big win from the absolute standpoint of time savings; but an even bigger win in a relative sense. In addition; powerful new “no-code” software allows business users — those closest to the opportunities for innovation — to deploy and configure systems themselves; with minimal dependence on technical resources. That allows companies to maximize their innovation “at bats” by investing in more ideas that come from employees at all levels and across all divisions of their organization. Empowering a broad range of knowledge workers to engage with their work in a richer; deeper; more meaningful way — and thereby transform their great ideas into innovative action — will feel like uncharted territory to leadership teams not accustomed to seeing business teams applying advanced technology. Embrace the benefits: unleashing the opportunity for innovation across an organization will lead to more base hits. I’ve watched as many business-driven innovations have; together; made a significant and positive impact on the business I lead and the people with whom I work. While all those base hits are great; technology is also helping drive more home runs than ever. Knowledge workers; empowered with tools to pursue more ideas at lower cost; can increasingly swing for the fences. And the innovative new companies they work for are increasingly rising up to challenge established businesses and even entire industries. Consider Uber; for example. Less than 10 years after its founding; it has disrupted taxi services in hundreds of cities worldwide. The company’s reported recent confidential filing for an initial public offering could give it a stunning valuation of as much as $120 billion. That’s more than the entire U.S. auto industry. Meanwhile; the price of a New York City taxi medallion has plunged from about $1 million in 2013; to about $200;000 today. And that actually demonstrates a new kind of risk — the risk of not facilitating innovation at all levels and missing out on new opportunities. The fact is that technology is lowering barriers for everyone. That means not just your current competition; but also companies that don’t even exist yet. And that’s what makes a company like Gillette vulnerable to Dollar Shave Club; and established cable providers vulnerable to Netflix. New technology isn’t always a zero-sum game; with winners driving losers out of business. Sometimes it creates entire new industries and opportunities; like digital home security systems; wearable tech like the Apple Watch; or digital assistants from Amazon; Google and others. Many of those opportunities haven’t even been identified yet. But we can say who will take advantage of them. It will be the more agile companies that empower their employees to innovate and iterate at a rapid pace. It will be the companies that continually adopt new technologies and experiment with them; with an eye toward creating value; not protecting it. Reconsidering the cost calculus and the evolving nature of risk are essential for businesses to find the best way forward in the era of disruptive technology. Every business leader; IT decision maker; and knowledge worker needs to recalibrate their assumptions about the costs and risks of business innovation.

Imagine a World Where…,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write Imagine a World Where… The Story of Your Startup Bryan Landers · Follow 3 min read · Jan 2; 2019 113 ‘Avatar: The Last Airbender’; Nickelodeon. One of the most crucial jobs of a founder is to tell stories. Origin story; mission story; product story; opportunity story... You tell stories to yourself; your friends and family; co-founders; teammates; customers; investors; and press. Here’s a simple thought experiment extracted from fiction writing to help you tell the story about a future changed by the existence of your product or service. A good science fiction story can be reduced down to a simple framing. “Imagine a world where…” The quality of the work a writer does to realize a world determines the quality of the story and experience of the audience. What’s the difference between that world and the one we live in now? What happens to the people who live in that other world? What are the greatest challenges they may face? What new possibilities become reality? Here are a few examples. His Dark Materials — a trilogy of novels by Philip Pullman; including The Golden Compass. Imagine a world where the human soul was externalized. The inner-self of each person is manifested as an animal form; which leads to a wonderful dynamic between characters and their “daemons”; giving you clues about their personality and status within the world. The worst fear imaginable in this world would be the splitting of human and soul; which is precisely what the story plot explores. Avatar: The Last Airbender — an animated series by Bryan Konietzo and Michael Dante DiMartino. Imagine a world where people can manipulate the four classical elements of nature: fire; air; water; and Earth. To personify the tension and harmony between the elements; powers for each element are distributed to a different nation in the world and corresponding social attributes result. Give one nation the greed to seek absolute power to thrust the world into an epic drama. The same concept works well when considering startup ideas. Uber/Lyft. Imagine a world where no one owned a car. How would we get around? Who would be the driver? What would change about our cities? Snapchat. Imagine a world where digital photos didn’t last forever. How might people share photos differently? How would that change the content? What would that do to engagement? Airbnb. Imagine a world where anyone could have access to local lodging and experiences anywhere. Who would rent out space in their home? Who would stay in the home of a stranger? What impact would this have on the hotel and travel industries? What tools would need to be created to facilitate these new relationships and interactions? (Bonus note: Airbnb heavily used storyboards to craft their guest and host experiences.) Counterintuitively with startups; the more unbelievable the story premise; the more potentially successful it will be if it works. Transformational; disruptive ideas will often seem terrible until reality proves that they’re not. Interestingly; you don’t always need to sell big cultural or economic transformation to the first users of your product. Uber needed only to convince people that they could push a button and get a ride to take them where they wanted to go. Airbnb needed only to convince people that they could rent a space where they needed to be. The best story to tell is the one that inspires the action you want people to take. You can use this thought experiment to inspire a creative mindset to frame your idea and the resulting consequences to write a compelling story to share when recruiting; fundraising; and selling. What story are you telling? Thanks to Sahil Lavingia for the conversation which inspired this story. He’s the founder of Gumroad; a profitable startup that makes it easy for creators to sell their work. He escaped Silicon Valley and lived to tell the tale; now as an artist and writer in Utah. Sahil recently published his first speculative fiction short story; Across the Border. Sign up to discover human stories that deepen your understanding of the world. Free Distraction-free reading.

Two Main Reasons Why Apple Products Are Super Expensive,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write Two Main Reasons Why Apple Products Are Super Expensive Samuel Halimanto · Follow 4 min read · Jan 2; 2019 “No matter how much it cost. There will always be someone who buys it.” Pricey? Yes it is. Same specs higher price? Yes it is. But there are reasons for it. When you buy Apple product; let’s say iPhone; you don’t only buy iPhone. There are more to it. The Software I make software in my daily life; and of course I get paid by my clients for it. But who pay for the iOS; macOS; and every software Apple makes? Unlike android phone manufacturers; who get their software freely from Google; Apple has to do it’s own R&D (Research and Development) and maintenance for its software. And yes it is very costly. According to appleinsider.com; in Q3 2018 Apple has spent $3.7 billion for R&D. So who pay for it? The answer is; Apple users do! Think about this; the price for every Apple products are including the software inside it. So if you buy an iPhone for lets say $800; maybe $200 in it is the software; and the phone without the software is only $600. That’s why you can’t find other phone using iOS; because they are selling the software too. Not only the software inside the phone. You buy the maintenance and updates for those software too. Lets take iPad 2 which came out in 2011 and got its last iOS update at 2016. If you bought iPad 2 by 2011; you got update for 5 years without having to pay anything more. It’s like a subscription for 5 years that you pay in front. The Brand Apple fanboys are EVERYWHERE. No matter what apple do; the fanboy will buy their products. But how? How could people fall in love with “Apple” as a brand without thinking about the specs or anything else? A simple scenario: Two friends coming to you; one uses iPhone; another uses Chinese phone. Your subconscious will think about them differently; won’t it? Why? Because Apple has merged into our lifestyle and it gives luxury to the users. People are willing to pay high to get that Apple logo printed on their devices; because it gives them the luxury. This is why every Apple products are expensive and will always be expensive. Selling something cheap will remove the luxury that Apple gives to the users. Those luxury that Apple gives is not cheap though. First; they have to limit their products to be only the high end products. It reduces their selling. And then the marketing is pricey too. Have you ever seen a bad looking Apple store? Nope; because it’s part of the marketing team to make Apple looks luxurious and exclusive. But; who pay for the selling margin and the marketing fee? Guess who? Despite being really expensive; people still buy it. There are many reasons for it. The hardware; the great design; or even specific needs for a job (like a programmer or designer). Apple products are unique; exclusive; and have its own feel and style. But is it worth the super price though? The answer varies. Here is my thought; in phone industry; as a Galaxy phone owner; I’m on Samsung’s side for now. It does more with lower price; the build quality is better; the hardware is better; and most of all; the display is far more superior than iPhone. For Mac; I think they have the best design and build quality compared to other laptops. But the price is really really high for those specs. The Mac OS is still a little bit behind Windows too in my opinion. But; if money is not a problem for me; I would go for it. In tablet industry; I don’t think iPad has any competitor though. The 2nd best tablet is not even close to the iPad as a king. I will not think twice to buy an iPad if I ever need a tablet. Well; I’m not an Apple fanboy myself; but I think despite being really expensive; Apple has reasons for it and people who buy it have their own reasons too. It’s a matter of preference.

From summer fellow to full-time employee,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write From summer fellow to full-time employee Rebecca Gray shares her perspective on the transition from fellow to full-time analyst at the City of Boston’s Department of Innovation and Technology. City of Boston · Follow Published in Innovation and Technology · 3 min read · Jan 2; 2019 -- Department of Innovation and Technology (DoIT) fellows have the chance to act as problem solvers on behalf of the City of Boston. After completing an Analytics fellowship last summer; I joined the citywide Analytics Team as a full-time data and performance analyst. My fellowship gave me an inside perspective on what it takes to move a large data project forward and develop strong working relationships in the context of local government. Rebecca Gray now works full-time on the City’s Analytics Team. Thinking of applying? In case you’re on the fence; here are my thoughts on what a summer at DoIT can offer. 1. Find yourself at the intersection of data and public service. As a DoIT fellow; you will be stationed at the heart of timely; impactful work (not to mention the heart of Boston). During my fellowship; I worked with the Boston Public Health Commission (BPHC) to expand healthcare access in the City. Together; we built a web-based app to guide health insurance applicants through the enrollment process. At DoIT; you can grow as a data analyst without sacrificing your penchant for civic engagement. 2. Work toward tangible goals — with help. DoIT fellowships are structured with your development in mind. A personal mentor will help you scope and execute a long-term project based on your personal interests. My mentor brought valuable experience in both data science and project management to my fellowship. She was — unwaveringly — in my corner; whether that meant proofreading an email; troubleshooting over coffee; or simply sharing stories of her own experience as a public servant. This summer; skip the busy work. DoIT will equip you with the time and tools to develop robust; polished deliverables. 3. Grow as a professional. Data is only as powerful as our ability to communicate its meaning. At DoIT; we work with data from departments across the City. Frequent; two-way communication is therefore critical to building trust and ensuring project success. One example? My teammates at BPHC loved the first iteration of my app; with one caveat: many Bostonians speak a primary language other than English. Seeking their feedback allowed me to include multilingual app features; and thus create a more accessible product. Spearheading your own project means ample practice in stakeholder communication and data translation — skills that will come in handy long after your fellowship draws to a close. Come join us at the City of Boston this summer! Right now; you can apply to join our team as a Digital or Analytics fellow for summer 2019. Not sure if you qualify? Don’t count yourself out. In the past; DoIT has welcomed awesome fellows from many disciplines; including engineering; geography; public health; and urban planning. If you enjoy solving problems with data and are energized by public service; then you are who we’re looking for. And who knows — you could end up on the team for good!

New in Symfony 4.3: Always Include Route Default Values,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write New in Symfony 4.3: Always Include Route Default Values Symfony · Follow 2 min read · Jan 2; 2019 -- Contributed by Vladimir Luchaninov in #29599. In Symfony applications; you can give route placeholders a default value so they can be omitted from the generated URL. Consider this route definition: namespace App\Controller;  use Symfony\Bundle\FrameworkBundle\Controller\AbstractController; use Symfony\Component\Routing\Annotation\Route;  class BlogController extends AbstractController {     /**      * @Route("/blog/{page}"; name="blog_list")      */     public function list($page = 1)     {         // ...     } } If you don’t provide the value of the page variable when generating the URL for the blog_list route; the resulting URL will be /blog and the value of the page placeholder will be 1: $router = ... // a UrlGeneratorInterface instance  $url = $router->generate('blog_list');                // /blog $url = $router->generate('blog_list'; ['page' => 1]); // /blog/1 $url = $router->generate('blog_list'; ['page' => 7]); // /blog/7 Although this is the desired behavior in most applications; sometimes you may prefer to always include the value of the placeholder; even when you don’t provide it while generating the URL. In Symfony 4.3 we made this possible with a new syntax for route placeholders: /**  * @Route("/blog/{!page}"; name="blog_list")  */ public function list($page = 1) {     // ... } The ! character before the placeholder name tells Symfony to always include its value in the generated URL; no matter if it's a default value: $url = $router->generate('blog_list');                // /blog/1 $url = $router->generate('blog_list'; ['page' => 1]); // /blog/1 $url = $router->generate('blog_list'; ['page' => 7]); // /blog/7 Sign up to discover human stories that deepen your understanding of the world.

Surviving the technical jungle,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write Surviving the technical jungle Todd Kaplinger · Follow 2 min read · Jan 2; 2019 -- How do senior tech leaders remain technical? Every winter break; I find myself looking to evaluate and/or go deeper in a technology that I want to better understand heading into the new year. This appears to be very common in the twitterverse based upon a non-scientific twitter search of “holiday write code”. With technology; there are constant disruptions that if you do not pay attention to; you will quickly fall behind the disruption curve. One of the largest disruptions we have seen in recent years is the explosion of containers especially Kubernetes. If you are not aware of containers in 2019; you are definitely behind many in the technology field. How does a senior technical leader get deep enough to know the benefits of such a technology and when to apply them is a constant theme in my career. I decided in 2018 to shift gears in terms of my focus and spend more effort writing code during the year and not wait for the holidays. I wanted to focus on leveraging the latest technologies with the goal of expanding my knowledge base and to remain relevant in today’s economy. While I always considered myself apprised of the latest tech trends and could articulate the benefits of technology choices and architectures pretty well; I felt that I could do more. Since I think there are many others in this space that are looking for ways to remain relevant and to understand what others in the tech industry are doing to stay current; I wrote my perspective on the past year as it relates to my career and technology. If you would like to learn more about my journey in 2018; I would encourage you to read my latest article https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/one-developers-career-inflection-point-todd-kaplinger/ Sign up to discover human stories that deepen your understanding of the world.

IOT in your Hotel Bathroom?,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write IOT in your Hotel Bathroom? Chris Herbert · Follow 3 min read · Jan 2; 2019 11 The advent of AirBnB; VRBO; and others have give consumers more choices for where they stay on a vacation or business trip. This rapid rise of technology enabled new entrants have challenged hotels to compete. While some hotels have tightened their belts and focused on competing on price; others have seen this as an opportunity to differentiate themselves and focus on the guest experience. Many consumers believe that a better experience is worth the extra dollars. But how can you improve your current offering to guests? While there still opportunities on offering just premium versions of the basic essentials; there are plenty of opportunities to incorporate technology to enable a better guest experience and operational efficiency for the hotel operators. Alexa; The Hotel Concierge More Alexa devices are being added to hotels for the advantage of offering guests music selections and automated wake up alarms. The hotel industry is getting to a critical mass of Alexa integrations where software offerings are beginning to pop up. This skill offers a complete automated hotel concierge. Don’t know the wifi password? just ask Alexa. Need a resturaunt recommendation close by? just ask Alexa. Check out and close out the bill without the line? yes please. Smart Mirrors Intelligent mirrors are beginning to be marketed to the US consumer market and offering weather information and more. Some of these startups like MirrorCache is approaching the hospitality industry to offer room service options; temperature control; and a in room concierge. The convenience of accessing a concierge will continue to be a trend and multiple startups are beginning to enter this market. Robot Housekeeping? An interesting startup; Maidbot; is taking the idea of Roomba to the hospitality industry. This can be an interesting solution to offer a cleaner room while reducing one of the highest variable costs facing hotel operators. In the future; the technology will continue to improve to offer on demand cleaning and tracking of what rooms have been cleaned. Digital Toilets Visitors to hotels in Asia usually comment to friends on the cool toilet technology they found abroad. The innovations at Toto with a heated seat and bidet have been an excellent luxury experience to guests. New startups like where I’m working at; Shine; are expanding this experience with cost saving features for hotel operators such as self cleaning and remote leak detection. This is an opportunity for guests to experience a luxury not found in AirBnbs and for hotel operators to save money What innovations do you see impacting the hotel industry in the next 5 years?

10 Most Common Reasons Why Tech Startups Fail | Contxto,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write 10 Most Common Reasons Why Tech Startups Fail | Contxto Cortés Victor · Follow Published in DataDrivenInvestor · 8 min read · Jan 3; 2019 12 Contxto — 2019 represents a fresh start for most of us. We are motivated. We are thirsty for success; especially in our business life. However; as we already know; it is no easy task to start and grow a company from scratch; there are many ways in which we could screw up and fail. Yes; fail. And no matter what most motivational speakers and business gurus tell you about the goodness of failing; at the end of the day it still sucks! Today I present to you the 10 most common reasons why tech startups fail; so you are aware and you can do something about it before it’s too late. 10. Focusing On Vanity Metrics Vanity metrics do nothing for your actual website objectives; but make your marketing efforts look good. Jason Amunwa Sometimes founders find themselves tracking and measuring benchmarks that are not necessarily important to the company; meaning that they’re not directly related to its success (whatever their specific definition of success is). These are called Vanity Metrics; and even though they make you feel good about your business; they’re terrible for taking action. For example; tracking likes; number of followers and users instead of things like downloads; purchases; churn rate and retention rates; etc.; are more about feeling good rather than planning effectively. Vanity metrics are self-sabotaging and they’re named that way because many founders feel good with the delusion of a thriving business based on these metrics; instead of facing the cold hard truth. Here’s a quick comparative list of vanity metrics versus the truly useful engament metrics. 9. Trying To Tackle Everything At The Same Time Focus is a matter of deciding what things you’re not going to do. John Carmack There was a little company called Burbn; a platform for checking in places; reviewing the spots and also uploading pictures every now and then. Long story short; their initial model did not go as planned and they decided to focus on one thing: uploading pictures. So; Burbn grew some more and now it is a more or less known app called Instagram. Moral of the story? Do not name your startup after a spirit. Just joking; the moral is that focusing on one single thing and being the best at that one thing; will most likely boost you rather than detract you. Heinz; the ketchup company; can also confirm. 8. Weak Team In YC’s case; the number one cause of early death for startups is cofounder blowups. Sam Altman Team is key; people. A great product with a poor team will most likely burn down. While a great team with a poor product might find the way around. They pivot; they test; and most importantly they keep trying. There are many things that could go wrong with a weak team. Mainly; giving up too easily; co-founder conflicts and poor leadership. When things get ugly (and they will); co-founders usually have conflicts. If you and your team are not able to withstand those issues and push through; it will; most likely; fail. When things get ugly; most people do not have the gut and courage to keep going and they give up too easily. Finally; as a founder and leader you have to show your collaborators and employees that things will get better. If you display weakness and lack of confidence; they won’t feel safe either. A team that doesn’t believe in their leader always result in chaos. 7. Product Mistimed The right thing at the wrong time is the wrong thing. Joshua Harris Bad timing is also a well-known startup murderer. Some real-life examples include Myspace and Friendster. Most people believe being too late in a market is the only timing issue a company can face. However; being mistimed means being either too early or too late for the market. Here are some over-early companies:1. Webvan: Today Conershop/Instacart2. Pets.com: Today Petflow.com3. Letsbuyit.com: Today Groupon4. Beenz.com: Today Cryptocurrencies5. Justin.tv: Today Periscope Great timing is hard to predict; and there need to be many variables in place in order to successfully launch a startup. The pre-existence of enabling technologies; optimal economic conditions; and trends and cultural acceptance are key factors for founders to take into consideration. In his Ted Talk; Bill Gross explains why bad timing is the single most important reason for startup failure. I might not think it’s the number one reason; but certainly one of the most important. 6. Poor Marketing If you build it…you may still need Google AdWords. Jennifer Mesenbrink Straight to the point. Poor marketing is as bad as a bad product; if not worse. I’ve seen bad products with great marketing develop traction; but rarely gets a good product with bad marketing even noticed. Also; spending huge amounts of money in marketing just for the sake of doing so; with no real specific strategy and measurable goals can kill the company itself. This is closely related to point 2 (below). 5. No Business Model Get rich or die tryin’. 50 Cent Okay; I didn’t find any ad-hoc quote; but I like 50. Many times; the product is good; the marketing is great and the team is amazing. But many times; the product itself isn’t able to find a proper way to monetize its services. This is the problem many freemium services and media companies face. People use their products; but they’re not willing to pay for them. Also; there are companies whose monetization strategy started way too late and failed to implement it later on. Napster is a clear example. Even though there were 80 million users using the music sharing platform at the top of their game. They failed to implement a SaaS business model later on; after copyrights lawsuits started flooding the company. 4. Unit Economics and Unitary Price/Cost Issues The winners of a unit economics contest would be more likely to build successful companies. Brad Hargreaves Just like burn rates; this could be very much improved if only founders were a little bit self-aware. If your business does not make sense in unit terms; it will not be scalable in the long run. You need to know your margins; your cost structure; your LTV/CAC ratio and your revenue streams. If you do your calculations on a “per unit” basis; and it still doesn’t make sense; they do not seem realistic; or the outcome isn’t profitable; then no matter how many customers you reach and how many downloads you get; it will not be a business but a very costly hobby. Read more about Unit Economics here! 3. Competition All failed companies are the same: they failed to escape competition. Peter Thiel Peter Thiel has a very fatalistic perspective on competition. He believes than only companies that make it to “monopoly” status will be successful in the long run. I do not agree. Entirely. For me; competition is healthy; but it is also responsible for the death of millions of companies. Capitalism is a wild animal; and it doesn’t really care about anything other than supply and demand. Only the fittest will survive; and at the end of the day; consumers are the ones who decide that. Be clear about your vision and make sure to display that as an unhidden competitive advantage. Ask yourself honestly and consciously: Why would someone buy my product instead of the other options? 2. Running Out Of Cash Money is like gasoline during a road trip. You don’t want to run out of gas on your trip; but you’re not doing a tour of gas stations. Tim O’Reilly Yes; money is not the ultimate goal. It should not be. But that doesn’t mean you don’t need money. It is a means to an end; and it is not just helpful; but necessary. Most founders are very aware of this; but it is worth reassuring. Companies with suboptimal burn rates; and not enough sales to bootstrap their operations often find themselves sinking after their initial investment gets consumed. That is why it is crucial to always be aware of what your monthly expenditure is and to start planning the fundraising before running out of cash in the bank. Read more about how to improve burn rates here! 1. No Market Need The life of any startup can be divided into two parts — before product/market fit and after product/market fit. Marc Andreessen Painful. Painful stuff. What is worse than falling in love with a girl; buying her gifts and flowers; setting up dates and trying to make that person love you; just to find out she is not interested in you? Yeah; it sucks. But it is not nearly as bad as falling in love with an idea; developing the product; investing in marketing and ultimately finding out; people don’t care about it. Ouch! Many times; people let themselves go based on the sexiness of an idea; instead of actually realizing people have a need. Interestingly enough; sometimes the least sexy startups are the ones that have the biggest market opportunities. Perhaps because few people are willing to venture into that market? On the bright side; I can almost guarantee that no entrepreneur that has gone through this issue is going to make the same mistake again. Identify whether the market has a need and find a solution for it. Not the other way around. Failure is overrated. Do not aim for failure; rather try succeeding the first time and if you happen to fail; learn from it. Anyways; these 10 reasons will surely make you meditate on your new years' plans.

Cleaning Up The Chain Of Custody For Medical Implants With Blockchain,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write Cleaning Up The Chain Of Custody For Medical Implants With Blockchain Sam Rad 🔮 · Samantha Radocchia · Follow Published in Good Audience · 4 min read · Jan 3; 2019 104 Counterfeit goods are a massive global industry; worth almost half a trillion dollars worldwide. These items worm their way into just about every industry you can think of; including some you may have considered safe from the threat of fake products. In the early days of co-founding a startup focusing on supply chain solutions; I spoke with people from a variety of different industries who were worried about counterfeits and diversion in their supply chains. But one industry that stuck out to me; in particular; was medical devices. It’s difficult to imagine someone is out there counterfeiting life-saving devices or implants; but it does happen. In fact; more than $51 million in counterfeit medicine and medical devices were seized in an Interpol operation back in September 2017. It’s extremely disconcerting to hear the devices many rely on to keep them healthy may not; in fact; have been manufactured under rigorous scrutiny; but rather in an attempt to make a quick buck. Fortunately; the industry is well aware of the issue; and new technologies are making it easier than ever for companies to thwart counterfeiters. After optimizing enterprise supply chains for several years; here’s how I’ve found blockchain can help: Having a blockchain-run chain of custody (COC) will ease patients’ and providers’ peace of mind because it provides proof of origin. The implications of counterfeit medical devices are frightening. Patients who go in for hip replacements are expecting that hip to last 20 years or more. But they probably aren’t expecting to be fitted with artificial hips that are counterfeited and made of low-quality materials. If a fake implant is used; what was supposed to last them decades suddenly has a much shorter lifespan. And for devices like pacemakers; the stakes are even higher. With lives on the line; it’s necessary to have a chain of custody system that can help clean up supply chains. Without one; some of the products we trust to keep us healthy may actually have the opposite effect. For example; Boston Scientific’s use of polypropylene for gynecologic mesh implants recently came under scrutiny after more than 100;000 women filed lawsuits over the products. The plastic; originating from brokers in China; was deemed unsafe by experts. Yet after the supply of plastic was cut off; the company found another source in China — one that came with little visibility into the various steps in the supply chain. It’s simply unacceptable for patients and providers to be worried that the medical devices they’re using may have an unexpected effect on overall health. Digitizing chain of custody records and placing transactions on blockchain will eliminate many questions. Tracking a medical device is simply a way of ensuring two things: it’s coming from the correct place; and; if something goes wrong; there’s no question of where it originated. Blockchain is the best way of eliminating any unknowns or questions. Say you’re following the path an artificial hip takes as it travels from the manufacturer to the hospital; where it awaits a hip replacement patient. The hip is tagged with a unique cryptographic identifier that links it to an identity on the blockchain. Each time that hip trades hands; from the supplier onward; it’s possible to register the timestamp and geolocation on the blockchain — creating an immutable record about the implant’s chain of custody. If everyone in the supply chain is registering those transfers of custody; it becomes difficult for counterfeits to enter the supply chain. They would have no identifier; and even if they did; the record on blockchain would show they had not originated from the supplier or manufacturer. Working backward through the registered COC; it would be relatively easy to find out where the counterfeits had entered the supply chain. A large part of the value of blockchain is that the data on these supply chains will persist. Right now; if a company that’s tracking chain of custody goes out of business; that data may not be there 10 years later when a class action lawsuit begins. With blockchain; you know that the information will always be there. It’s not possible for the guilty party to have the classic “shred everything” Enron moment when auditors come knocking. Still; the goal isn’t to persecute companies within the industry; it’s to make sure they have better records that don’t allow anything to slip through the cracks in the first place. If you have an existing physical chain of custody; consider adding a blockchain backend. Chain of custody isn’t a new concept; and there are already different methods that companies can use to track products. Some are digital; while others rely on physical documents. If your company is already using a COC solution; it’s still a good idea to add a blockchain backend to help with asset management. Over time; the goal is for the medical devices industry to come together in a consortium and set standards for what they expect the chain of custody to look like for medical devices and implants. And once those standards have been set; and the industry has formed a network around them; new collaborative possibilities can happen. Counterfeits may be a pervasive problem; but not one that patients and doctors should have to worry about. With a tighter supply chain; backed by blockchain COC solutions; that goal can be turned into a reality.

Soarin’ High: How a Thrill-Seeking Entertainer Uses LiveMe to Document Her Adventures,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write Soarin’ High: How a Thrill-Seeking Entertainer Uses LiveMe to Document Her Adventures Team LiveMe · Follow Published in LiveMe Blog · 3 min read · Jan 2; 2019 41 Kaity Tainer attends LiveMe’s second annual Global Gala in Taiwan. She is an actress and model as well as a LiveMe broadcaster. For broadcasters around the world; LiveMe is a place to share their life; as well as their talents and passions. For Kaity Tainer (Kaity in Orbit 🌎); it’s all of those things and more. While she works as a model and actress; she’s also a thrill seeker and documents her adventures for her LiveMe fans to experience with her. We talked to Katy about her early days working at a zipline course; finding a community on LiveMe; and what the future holds. The Beginning: Before LiveMe Kaity is from University Place; Washington; and based on the variety of jobs she had growing up; it seems as if she’s always been ready and willing to try new things. “For a while; I was working at a zipline [and] ropes course and also at a float therapy center;” she told LiveMe. “I had always been interested in doing more different activities; diving into modeling; skydiving; and slacklining once I turned 18.” As she was preparing to graduate from high school; a fashion photographer who had recently moved from NYC took Kaity’s senior pictures as a favor to her mom. He immediately noticed that she was a natural in front of the camera. “He suggested I talk to other photographers in the Seattle area; as apparently; he thought I posed well and more similar to a fashion model than someone having their senior photos done;” she said. Later; after moving to Los Angeles to model professionally; Kaity discovered she enjoyed acting as well. “I started doing more acting gigs as they became available and I realized how fun that can be as well compared to still photography;” she said. “It’s so much fun to meet people on set; and I have found many friendships through doing commercials and random background work.” In 2017; Kaity appeared in the rock band The Plot in You’s music video for the song “FEEL NOTHING;” which has over 4 million views on YouTube. Building a Community on LiveMe While pursuing her career in the entertainment industry; Kaity came across LiveMe and in 10 short months; she’s amassed about 109;000 followers. “I love the sense of community I’ve found by connecting and checking in with people most days;” says Katy about the community she has on the platform. “I’ve built a strong connection with many of the people that watch my show; as well as the broadcasters that I tune in to.” Kaity broadcasts to her fans after skydiving; one of her favorite activities. She also enjoys slacklining and practices Reiki. Kaity; who refers to her followers as “friends” rather than fans; feels humbled by the following she has on LiveMe. “I always hope they feel that my broadcast is somewhere they can come to feel safe; accepted; and appreciated;” she said. What’s Next? In addition to broadcasting on LiveMe; Kaity has a few trips and various modeling opportunities in the works; but as we spoke to her; she was preparing for next adventure: a trip to Taiwan to attend LiveMe’s second Global Gala. Kaity was unsure of what to expect but excited to meet Mary Cameron Rogers; another Los Angeles-based broadcaster. Kaity (right) poses with LiveMe founder and CEO Yuki He (middle) and fellow U.S. broadcaster Mary Cameron Rogers (MC🌹) at LiveMe’s Global Gala. “I’m looking forward to seeing who all is here! I have no idea who is! I’m also stoked to be trekking out here with MC🌹!” We can’t wait to see where Kaity’s adventures lead her next! Want to read more interviews with LiveMe broadcasters?

The Dark Side of Assumption,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write The Dark Side of Assumption Levi Patton · Follow 6 min read · Jan 2; 2019 Assumptions are all around us. We make them all the time; often without thinking twice. As designers; we arm ourselves with all kinds of tools; techniques; and methodologies aimed at clearing the path of assumption so we can design for users; and not for ourselves. Still; assumptions are always out there; creeping in around the edges waiting for the right moment to slide in and cloud our judgment. Sometimes assumptions can be expensive. And there’s nothing like an assumption blowing up in your face to make you think twice about taking action without first having all the facts. Last month I made an assumption based on good-natured intentions that ended up costing $500; some strained relationships; and 100 pounds of spoiled meat. Allow me to explain. I live in the mountains where I rent a small carriage house above my landlord’s garage. I get to drink my morning coffee on a porch that sits at 7;500 feet and looks out at snow-capped peaks and miles of pine forest. Humblebrag aside; it is by far the most amazing place I have ever lived; and I’m super grateful that I get to call it home. Because of this; I have a lot of respect for the house; the property; and am in great standing with the landlord. So when he went out of town on a 10-day hunting trip this summer and left the light to one of the property’s outbuildings on; it only made sense to do the good-neighborly thing and shut the door — which was ajar — and turn off the light. I assumed that he had been working in the outbuilding during the day with the light on; and had forgotten to turn it off. I even had accumulated mental evidence (assumption ammunition) that this had to be the case. Not once in my 2+ years of living here had I ever seen that outbuilding with the light on. Also; with the door being partially open; something just didn’t seem right. It seemed so natural just to march over; turn off the light; close the door; and cash in on that ‘good deed glow.’ I didn’t even consider any alternatives as to what could be going on in that scenario. I thought I had just saved my landlord 10-days worth of wasted electricity and prevented some mountain animal from wandering into his storage room. I got a text from my landlord 10 days later: “I’m DESPERATELY trying to figure out when the light was turned off in the outbuilding.” An anxiety-boulder dropped in my stomach and started a panic-landslide through the rest of my body. I hadn’t even thought about the light in the garage since turning it off over a week earlier. My mind raced through the possibilities of what could be wrong. Was the light supposed to be on!? Why!? A cascade of panic-riddled assumptions ran through my head (assumption inception). I learned later that night that leaving the light on was indeed intentional. It just so happens that the power for the outbuilding is connected to that specific light switch; and that there was over 100 pounds of elk meat in a freezer tucked away in the corner of the room. In the 10 days since the power was shut off; the entire 100 pounds had gone rancid. The cost of butchering the meat alone was over $500; and it didn’t just belong to my landlord; but also to a group of friends from a previous trip who had expected to later receive their share. I was devastated. I honestly cannot remember a time where I felt so tremendously crushed with guilt. It was a Friday night after a long week; I had just made dinner; and was looking forward to enjoying the evening and the rest of the weekend. After the conversation with my landlord; I just sat there and stared at the cooling food feeling nauseous. A good-natured assumption I had made without a second guess had just caused some serious Friday night feel-bads. What went so wrong? The more I turned over the scenario in my mind; the more the idea of assumption became the core of this frustrating mess. Yes; I made some obvious assumptions regarding the decision to turn off the light: I assumed that leaving the light on was accidental I assumed that I was ‘doing the right thing’ I assumed that there was no connection between the light and anything else in the room (the freezer) However; flipping the perspective and examining my landlord's side of the story comes with another list of assumptions: He assumed that none of the tenants would think it was weird that a light was on day and night for over 10 days (a light that is never on) He assumed that none of the tenants would turn off the light; thinking that it was left on mistakenly He assumed that this unobvious connection between the light and the power to the freezer (that was known to him) would also be known to us What made this particular situation so disastrous; was that assumptions were made on both sides. Each of us saw the situation through the lens of our own narrow perspectives and didn’t think to dig a little deeper and empathize with the other players involved in the experience. Communication on either end could have easily helped to avoid a wasteful and depressing situation. A text about the light being on; or a sticky note on the light saying; “don’t turn this switch off” would have easily prevented things from turning out so grim. A text on my end saying; “hey; I just turned off the lights to the outbuilding” would have kept a depressing guilt-tsunami from flooding my Friday night. There is also the awkward issue of accountability. Who was more at fault in this scenario? Ultimately; I was asked to pay for “some or all of the $500+ cost of butchering the meat.” That’s a heavy price to pay for flipping a switch under the assumption that I was doing something good. Would you have turned off the light in this scenario? Would you pay the full $500? I tend to be a little more conscious of assumption-making these days. Even a small; seemingly benign assumption can have serious consequences. As a designer; I always try my best to eliminate assumptions when creating experiences for users; but also when anticipating the needs of clients; working with teams; and thinking through any creative problem-solving situation. Once you notice how assumption-riddled our day-to-day can be; it’s hard to unsee just how many auto-pilot decisions we make purely based on conjecture. To a certain extent; it’s unavoidable; and I think we have to be okay with that. As long as you take notice when you’re making an assumption; and ask yourself; “is there something I’m not seeing here… what could go wrong if I go through with this action without having all the facts?” Maybe this is just a recipe for overthinking-anxiety; which I already tend to be prone to. All I know is that from here on out; I’ll always think twice before turning off a light switch that isn't my own. Sign up to discover human stories that deepen your understanding of the world.

Building Transportation Clusters: Various Entrances into the End-to-End Space,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write Building Transportation Clusters: Various Entrances into the End-to-End Space Shorjoe Bhattacharya · Follow Published in DataDrivenInvestor · 5 min read · Jan 2; 2019 11 The dream of directly connecting import movements with export movements has always been one for many. Shipping Lines; Forwarders; Terminal Operators; etc have salivated at the possibility of having such a predictable and efficient network; where import containers can go directly to the nearest exporter’s place without having to go to empty yards; where significant time is lost in finding the next trip. Now; with improving visibility and formal data collection finally taking place in the segment; this dream is getting closer to becoming a reality. Containers going from an importer’s chemical factory to an exporter’s FMCG plant while getting cleared by a relayed container surveyor is becoming a reality! The; march towards this future is beginning with players trying to conquer certain clusters where they have visibility and control. So; during this early adopter stage; the various stakeholders are all entering the realm in different methods vying for the same outcome: an expansion in the space where they can directly cater to the freight owners; by connecting imports and exports in a single direct chain. In a country where more than 85% of long-haul freight moves by road transportation; the natural 1st layer elongation into the extended logistics segment is road logistics. These days’ road logistics is shifting towards efficient road optimization; where the truck can be optimized; while meeting predicted schedules. Thus the various stakeholders’ are looking to build their own lane cluster’s on routes they are familiar with; where they have a strong network and operational control. Operational control and a logistics network are the keys to operating a successful end to end logistics program; where additional cargo can be handled without significantly increasing costs. These lane clusters will be won over by the stakeholder’s who start controlling both the inward and outward flow of goods from a seaport/dry port on key routes. By having operational control and visibility of the lane cluster the provider can increase the value provided to the customer by offering more lucrative rates through efficiency gains. Until another player gains control and visibility of the route to provide better efficiency; other’s will not be able to play at the same price point; thus the likelihood of a shipper staying with the single provider will start growing on pure value terms more than relational terms. Different stakeholders in the space have had their own methods of entering the space based on the prior core operational strengths. But; they all are looking to build their road transportation clusters: Some examples of prominent formerly niche players building their networks are the following: Shipping Lines-Lines are trying to provide door to door services on certain routes where they have presence and comfort. They are offering to take a box from Dubai to an importer on India’s West Coast; on a transport route they are familiar with. This door to door service is predictable. But rather than just ending the E2E process they are doing container triangulation by themselves so the container is re-positioned to the nearest exporter/empty park location immediately. On certain West Coast route’s lines have built their clusters in such a way they are able to immediately reposition the container directly from the importer’s factory to the exporter’s factory (without going to the empty park) thus saving a significant amount of time and fuel finding another customer that needs a container. A line attempting to move a container directly from an importer’s factory to an exporter’s factory requires tremendously visibility and control of a route; thus lines are only focusing on lanes where they have enough demand visibility of both import and export. Shipping Agencies-Some large shipping agencies are starting to enter the Indian transportation segment by taking vehicles on a dry lease; where they are continually finding cargo to ensure at profitable vehicle utilization. Unless there are direct volume commitments; the lease model tends to be the riskiest. So; a strong understanding of the movement of goods on certain clusters is required. The lease model only really works if the operator knows: Monthly frequency of movements from locations on the route Size of Shipments Average Turnaround Time Destination The benefit of this model is its ability to provide strong control of transporters to the stakeholder; so the problem of availability of trucks reduces. If rapid expansion on clusters is desired; this model can be successful; as control of the truck allows the stakeholder to reposition in the truck to an exporter. Effectively this model can allow complete inward and outward movements control on key route clusters and may even allow for potential cargo diversions from other ports as 100% utilization routes can be controlled. Terminal Operators- Terminal Operators are looking to expand their footprint by building cargo community networks that are connected to individual route clusters These trade community networks collaborate with Port Community System’s; where the ecosystem can interact and share information. This process makes it easier to file manifests. This integrated system also helps customers located on key routes have access to services in a single window. For example; Pondicherry cluster is near Chennai Port Trust. From the portal; the Pondicherry customers can take quotations and can file clearances and on the cargo community network. Besides transportation; this additional service from the local terminal operator eases the work of local customers and can help increase choices when selecting services; as transporters; CHA’s and other service providers can be cross-compared on the trade network that is linked with the local PCS. Since container shipping began in 1947; providers have always talked about door to door service; where a shipper can book a container and it is delivered by the single stakeholder arranging and providing all services seamlessly. Service providers are getting closer and closer to that future as they are powerful companies in the logistics chain with a strong global presence. Building key transportation clusters have been the start to such a future. Only; now with growing transportation visibility and machine learning predictability has such a model become possible. Matching imports and exports on core routes have always been about having options in connecting pairs. These flexible options in connecting pairs are critical as predictable vehicle turnaround time is crucial in reducing uncertainty and in getting this model to work. With options in connecting pairs; it becomes possible to connect a trip to a large importers place to small exporter A; small exporter B; or small exporter C. The power of historical data also provides the “best exporter/importer pick” based on previous turnaround time and truck performance. This optimal pick model is what can make this successful. So; just like how uber or airbnb have very accurate algorithms in their spaces; the logistics players with the deepest visibility on their routes; will take it all and become the single service provider; where they directly connect import cargo owners to export cargo owners in a single move.

Performing Magic using your smart watch,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write Performing Magic using your smart watch Carlos Justiniano · Follow 2 min read · Jan 2; 2019 2 Like many youngsters; I grew up watching magicians on television. During my years in high-school I had one of the coolest jobs a teenager could have; I worked part-time at the local magic shop. The shop was more than just a shop. It was a workshop where magic tricks and larger stage illusions were created and sold to professionals. While I loved and still love magic; my journey lied in technology. Recently; I had the pleasure to combine my two loves. A quick search on YouTube revealed tricks using mobile phones; but I didn’t find any using a smart watch. I knew that the idea of using a less assuming device such as a watch could potentially create a more compelling effect. I decided to create a magic trick anyone could perform using their Samsung smart watch. Why the Samsung watch? Because it’s the one I own and one that allowed me to combine my other love for web-stack technologies. My first app idea involves the magician showing an audience member several ESP symbols and asking them to select one. The same symbol appears on the magician’s watch face. I built the app and a couple of weeks later; Magic: ESP Test was available in the Samsung Galaxy app store. I later had an idea for a card trick that allows the magician to ask a volunteer to chose a card and to then have the card appear in a smart watch. This is particularly effective because the participant believes they’re freely choosing a card and that card then appears in the watch. The effect can be repeated with a different card appearing each time. I went on to create a few other apps; some a bit less magical but still entertaining. Checkout: “Magic: Card in Watch”; “Magic: ESP Test”; “Magic: Trick Coin Flip”; “Magic: Trick Dice” and “Magic: Noltar” in the Samsung Galaxy App Store. For now; I’ve turned some of my hobby time attention back to traditional game development. I’m currently building a game engine designed for the Samsung Gear S2; S3; Sport and Galaxy smart watches. My first game; Tyros; is scheduled for a late January release. — Thanks for reading! If you like what you read; hold the clap button below so that others may find this.

Hackers Collaborate to Encourage People to Subscribe to PewDiePie (Again),Open in app Sign up Sign in Write Hackers Collaborate to Encourage People to Subscribe to PewDiePie (Again) Glen Whillier · Follow 2 min read · Jan 3; 2019 15 Image Credit: TheHackerGiraffe The past year has seen YouTuber PewDiePie incorporated in a handful of creative hacks. Presumably this is because PewDiePie’s #1 spot has been threatened by Indian rival T-Series; so loyal fans have been resorting to potentially less legal means of attracting new subscribers. The most recent hack dubbed #CastHack exploits vulnerable Google Chromecasts; smart TVs and Google Homes by renaming devices “HACKED_SUB2PEWDS_#” and by displaying unauthorized video that both notifies the victim of their vulnerability as well as encouraging them to subscribe to PewDiePie. Via HackerGiraffe’s Twitter CastHack is the work of the hacker duo HackerGiraffe and j3ws3r. The same duo behind another recent hack that occurred back in November which forced tens of thousands of printers to print paper that encouraged people to subscribe to PewDiePie. PewDiePie chimes in | Twitter The duo maintain though that their hacks are more about exposing vulnerabilities than about either promoting PewDiePie or harming anyone. “We’re only trying to protect you and inform you of this [vulnerability] before someone takes real advantage of it.” HackerGiraffe even condemned the actions of those who hacked the Wall Street Journal to promote PewDiePie. “The Wall Street [_Journal_] one was harmful and goes against what we stand for” It appears Sonos is next on the target list | HackerGiraffe’s Twitter If You’re Affected For anyone affected by the hack the best way to fix it as confirmed by both Google and HackerGiraffe is “Disable UPnP on your router; and if you’re port forwarding ports 8008/8443/8009 then STOP forwarding them.” This is because this is a router exploit; it takes advantage of incorrectly set up routers.

The 3 Phases of a Technology Product Implementation — Phase 1: Engagement,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write The 3 Phases of a Technology Product Implementation — Phase 1: Engagement productOps · Follow Published in productOps · 3 min read · Jan 3; 2019 by Steve Yatson The purpose of this blog series is to walk through our product development process from the perspective of a manager on the product/design team. As we’ve refined and developed it over the years it has become known to us internally as the productOps Way. productOps Team Members at Work The example referenced is the set-up of a Sales Order Management System for Ithaka; an education technology company; but our approach is similar for all the projects we work on. Using this example; I hope to show the way various departments of our organization work with each other; and the client; to guide a successful outcome using a three phased methodology. The Engagement Phase In the first phase of any project the executive team will travel to a potential client and get travel points and five star meals. On their return; the product and design team will get notes; a debrief; and image like this: Whiteboard sketch from first meeting Do I sound bitter? In seriousness; this phase is an important and necessary step to understand the core needs and build a relationship with the client. The latter is usually achieved more readily after this first visit because most times neither the client nor ourselves have a firm grasp yet on what’s needed; the devilish details involved and the business or technical problem at hand. Establishing a Statement of Work (SOW) To get closer to the goal; the whiteboard sketches are cleaned up and simplified so the project managers and designers can begin to understand the scope of work and build a SOW for the discovery phase. Cleaning up the whiteboard We then move from the whiteboard to a popular diagramming and digital illustration application; OmniGraffle; for a clearer vision of the project details. Transferring the specs into OmniGraffle Before launching into the discovery phase we want to make sure we’ve engaged with every stakeholder in the project and get as many of the requirements down up front as possible. Reflecting the project back to the client visually is a key strategy in making that happen. Once we’ve established the needs of the client; we move onto to Part 2; The Discovery Phase to be published next. Steve Yatson joined productOps in 2015 as a Sr. Product Designer. He now commands a senior management position in the company; guiding his staff and productOps customers to mutual success.

CHURCH APPS — are they helpful? Or just a waste of time?,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write CHURCH APPS — are they helpful? Or just a waste of time? Justin @ bltn · Follow 3 min read · Jan 3; 2019 Does your church have an app? They’re supposed to be “the thing” to do when it comes to connecting to your congregation; but I have to wonder — do they really work? Are your members actually using your app to engage during the service? Do they check it throughout the week for updates or announcements? Maybe it’s time to sit back and evaluate the ways we spend our hours as church communicators. If we are waisting our time doing something. Let’s stop doing that thing. Sound good? The church app is one of those things that seems like a given at this point. Apps are for everywhere and for everything. If you use an app at your church; when it was first introduced; it was a source of pride that you could tell your congregation to find you in the App Store. But those days are gone. Apps have been around for a decade and now it’s an embarrassment if you don’t have one. Right? Church Apps fill the same role as any piece of technology. They are designed to serve a purpose and solve a problem. Do church apps still serve a purpose and solve a problem? Over the last 10 years; for various reasons of travel and church planting; my family has been regular attenders at 5 churches and we’ve been repeat visitors to probably 10 more. Over that time; for those 15 churches; I have downloaded 1 church app. And I’ve used that app twice. (for work I’ve seen many other church apps and e-bulletins; and such; but that’s beside the point.) Maybe you use your church app all the time. Maybe your congregation loves it. And that’s awesome. The truth of it is though that every problem that the church app is designed to solve is better solved by something else. The media player in your church app allows your congregation to listen to and watch services. 78% of all video streaming online is watched via YouTube; the multi-billion dollar company. More of your congregation is watching video in YouTube than in your app. I don’t know your church or your congregation. But I’d wager anything that it is true. If last week’s sermon popped up in their subscription feed rather than in your app; how much more likely do you think it is that it will get seen? Your church app allows you to push messages to your congregation. Assuming your church app performs like any other app. For every 2 people that download the app; 1 of them will say NO to your notifications. But that’s the good news! For every 100 people to whom you send a notification; 3–6 of them will read it. Your mileage may vary of course; but the statistics on the technology of push notifications paint a very clear picture. Push notifications sent from your app do not work. Maybe you’ve trained your congregation to read them or to check in the app frequently for news; and that’s awesome. But if your announcement is where your congregation already is… facebook (~41 minutes each day); instagram (25–31 minutes each day); twitter (42% of twitter users use it every day). If you announcement is there; it is certainly more likely to be seen. You need a change of strategy. Instead of providing a place where people come to get stuff from you…. be someone who goes to where they are. The church app relies on your congregation to seek you out (and on a whole; they won’t). But a service like bltn puts your message where your congregation is. While spending less time than managing your church app; you can publish a mobile bulletin and deliver it to your congregations phones. You can set up a whole week’s worth of announcements on all your social media accounts. And you can put a paper bulletin in the hand of each member of your congregation Sunday morning. The numbers tell a story; and that story is… you should use bltn at your church. What are your thoughts? Does your church have use an app? What works well about it? What doesn’t?

HIGH-TECH PRAYER BREAKFAST = A STUPID WASTE OF TIME,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write HIGH-TECH PRAYER BREAKFAST = A STUPID WASTE OF TIME Todd Miechiels · Follow 4 min read · Jan 3; 2019 -- That’s what I thought 15 years ago. I was the co-founder of Medium Blue; a B2B Search Engine Agency. Sure I was a nice guy. I served people; tried to do the right thing. I loved networking as much as the next guy; but a “prayer breakfast”? Come on. That’s what the Holy Rollers; Bible Thumpers; Street Preachers; and Jesus Freaks do. High Tech Ministries is hosting their annual prayer breakfast October 12th in Atlanta. You may be attending; you may have been invited; or you may never have heard of it. Either way; I wanted to share my story about it. Bo Simmons invited me to my first one 15 years ago. I wasn’t interested in Jesus; I had fallen away from the church after middle school; but the networking seemed like it would be good. The next year Kathy Jaques invited me and I heard a great speaker; saw some friends I haven’t seen in a while; and went back to work. The next year Andy Williams invited me to sit at his table. They gave each of us a little pocket-sized Gospel of John; which I politely put in my suit pocket. It would stay there for another two years until I found it while taking the suit to the dry cleaners. I was depressed; lost; hopeless; and looking for a way out. I had been essentially forced to sell my share of the agency; had more money in the bank then I ever thought I’d have; and went from being with people 50 hours a week; to sitting completing by myself with the shades lowered in a tiny room for months after the sale. I was searching for answers. Zen; Wayne Dyer; Oprah; Don’t Sweat the Small Stuff; meditation; you name it. While reading that Gospel of John in my hand on a front stoop of a building in Tucker; searching HARD for an answer or way out of my misery; I felt an almost PHYSICAL rush go through my body; like a freight train passing me by. I had never experienced anything like it before or since. At that moment in tears; and quietly; but outloud I said “God it’s yours. I’m yours. I’m tired of running from you. I’m tired of hiding from you. I’m tired of trying to do things my way; to please others. I surrender.” It wasn’t just that book; or those invites to the prayer breakfast. It was my parents and so many others raising me in a loving Christian home and church; it was God putting guys in my life like Kevin Shaw; Art Foster; Dale Huff; Dan McDade; that took the time to answer questions I had; or demonstrate the love of Christ. Looking back I realize God was pursuing me along. Being a Christian has been no bed of roses; I have more questions now then when I started. Why are “christians” so full of hate; selfishness; divisiveness? Why don’t ‘christians’ act and sound more like Jesus? Why are so many churches ran like businesses and enterprises? Why does our country have so much when; others have so little; when our country has all but turned our backs to God? Following Jesus can feel like walking on a tightrope with a 100 MPH wind and no safety net. Having a personal relationship with the living Jesus; is the ONLY thing that keeps me going. And it’s only in Him that I’m content and satisfied and at peace in NOT knowing the answers to all the questions. If this all sounds like rubbish and nonsense. I completely understand. It would have to me too. All I can tell you is when I sought Him; He found me. When I knocked; He answered. It wasn’t the knock of a curious thinker; or a cynic or a skeptic; or someone looking for a magic bullet; I had knocked all those ways over the years. It was the knock of a broken and empty heart who finally admitted that he needed a Savior. If you’re still reading this; it’s probably because you were meant to; it’s no accident. If you can make it to this year’s breakfast; DO IT. Whether you think it’s stupid or not. Whether you think you’re too busy or not. And if you are a follower of Christ and reading this; there are people in your life you know don’t have a relationship with Jesus; PLEASE invite them. They may think it’s stupid; but they won’t think you’re stupid; only that you care enough about them to have invited them. YOU may be one that God wants to use. Don’t worry about what happens; you may never know the outcome or result in this lifetime. I’m grateful that through technology and testimony; I can witness and give thanks to some who took the time and care that led to not only my salvation; but my calling to ministry (and that’s whole other story). What is it that God may be wanting you to know about this? Turn away from the screen; take 3 deeeeeepp breaths and ASK Him. Even if that sounds stupid :) Peace and love; Todd Sign up to discover human stories that deepen your understanding of the world. Free Distraction-free reading. No ads.

The Biggest Technology Failures of 2018,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write Member-only story The Biggest Technology Failures of 2018 From gene-edited babies to guaranteed-fatal brain uploads; it was a bumper year for technology misfires and misuses MIT Technology Review · Follow Published in MIT Technology Review · 6 min read · Dec 28; 2018 3.2K 9 Credit: John Ueland By Antonio Regalado It was the year that technology — and the people who create it — seemingly could do no right; and did much that was wrong. As one of my sources put it in a tweet reacting to a dumb tech stunt; “2018 can’t end soon enough.” For the past few years MIT Technology Review has published a list of what we consider the most pointless or destructive uses of technology (here are 2017; 2016; 2015; and 2014). This year; though; the naughty were naughtier and the wrongs seemed wronger: technology was used to spread hate and addiction; to justify suicide; and to experiment on newborn children. Here’s our list of the very worst. CRISPR Babies Photo: The National Academies/Flickr/CC BY-NC-SA 2.0 We all knew that gene-edited humans would one day be born; but nobody wanted it to happen so soon; and definitely not like this. In November; MIT Technology Review reported that He Jiankui; a scientist at the Southern University of Science and Technology in Shenzhen; China; had secretly launched the first attempt to create children with edited genes. He edited human embryos using the molecular tool CRISPR to remove a single gene. He claimed that twin girls — named Lula and Lala — had been born and that they would be immune to HIV because of how he’d altered their genomes. The editing; though; didn’t go particularly well and wasn’t even necessary — there are cheaper and easier ways to prevent HIV infection. It now looks as though the twins were the unconsenting subjects of a reckless bid for a scientific first. He; who was hoping for a Nobel Prize; is instead under investigation in China.

Marten Cats · Follow 4 min read · Jan 2; 2019 -- 1 Let me regale you with a tale as old as time. Our story begins almost 4 billion years ago in the primordial soup of baby Earth’s oceans. “We are the pinnacle of life!” exclaimed the single celled organism. “All of our friends are single celled; our parents were single celled and our progeny will be single celled. Nothing that comes from us will ever be more than single celled!” Accurate historical representation. Then multi-celled organisms appeared. “We are the pinnacle of life!” exclaimed the multi-celled organism. “All of our friends; well most of our friends; are multi-celled. Our parents were multi-celled and our progeny will be multi-celled. Nothing that comes from us will ever be more than multi-celled!” Then complex multi-cellular organisms appeared. “We are the pinnacle of life!” exclaimed the jellyfish. “All of our friends; well most of our friends; are complex multi-cellular organisms. Our parents were complex multi-cellular organisms and our progeny will be complex multi-cellular organisms. Nothing that comes from us will ever be more than another complex multi-cellular organism!” War between the 4-tentacled and 3-tentacled jellyfish raged for almost four and half centuries before a truce was struck. Then the first backboned fish appeared. “We are the pinnacle of life!” exclaimed the fish. “All of our friends; well most of our friends; are fish. Our parents were fish and our progeny will be fish. Nothing that comes from us will ever be more than just another fish!” Then life appeared on land. “We are the pinnacle of life!” exclaimed the amphibian. “All of our friends; well most of our friends; are amphibians. Our parents were amphibians and our progeny will be amphibians. Nothing that comes from us will ever be more than just another amphibian!” Then reptiles left the water altogether. “We are the pinnacle of life!” exclaimed the reptile. “All of our friends; well most of our friends; are reptiles. Our parents were reptiles and our progeny will be reptiles. Nothing that comes from us will ever be more than just another reptile!” Dramatic portrayal of the asteroid that created the Chicxulub crater and contributed to the extinction of the dinosaurs. Then mammals appeared; and with them; humans. “Fire is the best source of light!” exclaimed the human. “Everyone I know uses fire to see in the dark. My parents used fire and my progeny will use fire. Nothing will surpass fire’s lighting abilities!” Until the light bulb did. “Horses are the fastest way to get around!” exclaimed the human. “Everyone I know rides a horse. My parents rode horses and my progeny will ride horses. Nothing will surpass the horse’s speed!” Until the automobile did. Or the train. Take your pick. “Humans are the smartest entities around!” exclaimed the human. “Humans always beat machines when playing Chess. My parents could beat a machine in a game of Chess and my progeny will be able to beat a machine in a game of Chess. Nothing we create will surpass human skill in the game of Chess!” Until Deep Blue did. At least Mike Tyson freed Bobby Fischer’s brain from its torture. “No matter!” shouted the human. “Chess playing machines can only play chess. Humans can play Chess; Go and Shogi too! My parents could play many different games and my progeny will be able to play many different games. Nothing we create will surpass the general game playing skills humans possess!” Until AlphaZero did (it mastered Chess; Go and Shogi). “No matter!” shouted the human; louder still. “AlphaZero can only play games. Humans can drive cars; write music; converse in natural language and create impressive machines like AlphaZero. My parents possessed a general intelligence and my progeny will also possess a general intelligence. Nothing we create will surpass human general intelligence!” The human being. It continues to see itself as the pinnacle of intelligence. Then artificial intelligence appeared. Sign up to discover human stories that deepen your understanding of the world.

A Simple Guide to Digital Signage,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write A Simple Guide to Digital Signage Vanessa Bernauer · Follow Published in Screenspace · 6 min read · Jan 2; 2019 5 1 Times Square and Piccadilly Circus have been synonymous with brightly illuminated signs for nearly 100 years; captivating visitors with the logos and slogans of the world’s biggest brands. But; in the last few years; there has been a sea change. Fuelled by Internet connectivity and the increasing availability of low-cost screens; Digital Signage is no longer restricted to major brands with budgets to match. So where does that leave you; and your business? If; like many; you have been watching the Digital Signage revolution from the sidelines (or maybe you have even stuck your toe in the water) — then this guide will provide you with a solid foundation so you’re ready to take the plunge. What exactly does Digital Signage mean? The term Digital Signage covers a confusingly broad range of technology; from electronic signs at a bus stop; right up to the huge screens you might find at a sports stadium. Ask an industry expert and he will tell you that Wow! Put simply; Digital Signage enables you to create and display any kind of content on one or more TV screens — all centrally controlled through the software. Who is Digital Signage for? There are very few types of business where you won’t find Digital Signage being effectively employed today. If there was a case for an advertising poster or an information board; there’s now a case for a digital signage screen that will do the job more effectively. Seven places you’ll find Digital Signage Retail If you’re selling to the public; you’ll sell more with Digital Signage! Communicate special offers and promotions to your customers while they’re exactly where you want them — in your store. Events In an environment where messages need to be frequently updated; or in temporary locations; Digital Signage provides the flexibility you need. Healthcare In hospitals; medical practices and dental surgeries Digital Signage is being used to provide timely information; promote awareness and greatly reduce perceived waiting times. Hotels & hospitality No longer the sole domain of premium establishments; Digital Signage is now effectively employed in many hotel lobbies; conference facilities; spas; bars and restaurants. Fitness & wellbeing With a constant roster of changing class schedules to advertise along with event promotions; club news and other health-related information; Digital Signage is very widely used Corporate Digital Signage provides a highly effective means of improving corporate communication and increasing motivation among business teams. Education Much more effective than a noticeboard; Digital Signage will inform students and parents about school events. How does it work? A typical Digital Signage set-up will consist of three elements: Screens A normal TV is enough to get started. Digital Signage players One per screen; usually a small box attached externally but sometimes built into some Smart TVs. Software A Content Management System for creating your content and sending it to your screens. Digital Signage systems range from the super-simple to the exceedingly complex. The one that’s right for you will depend on your needs; and your budget. Usually; your Digital Signage players will need to be connected to the internet; either by WiFi or Ethernet; so that your software can deliver the content that you have created. Most Digital Signage software enables you to easily create adverts from text; images and logos. Often you can use video and animations to make your content more appealing. Five reasons not to ignore Digital Signage In an increasingly competitive world; it’s more important than ever to make sure that you communicate effectively with your audience; whoever they are. Here’s why you can no longer ignore the power of Digital Signage as a medium for doing so: It gets results All the evidence shows that Digital Signage is more effective than printed material at grabbing the attention of your audience. Furthermore; recall of Digital Signage ads is higher than almost any other kind of advertising. All this translates to more profit on your bottom line. It’s flexible Have you ever wished you could change your printed ads at different times of the day; or make the space on the wall work harder by displaying more than one ad at a time? Digital Signage gives you the flexibility to do both at the click of a mouse. It’s better for the environment Change your ads as often as you like without incurring any printing or delivery costs; and without generating any waste. Today’s energy-saving LED screens are extremely efficient so your running costs are low. It’s easy to get started Switching to Digital Signage is easy — you can even re-use your existing content! Some systems offer a range of templates to help you get started so all you need to do is edit the text and add a logo. It’s surprisingly affordable The initial investment in Digital Signage is surprisingly low given the tumbling cost of TV screens. Prices vary widely for Digital Signage players and software but if you make sure you’re not paying for sophisticated features that you won’t necessarily need; the running costs can be very modest and will often be outweighed by the savings on printed material. Digital Signage versus traditional signage Why digital signage knocks spots off old-fashioned printed signage… What features do I need? Usually; your Digital Signage players will need to be connected to the Internet; either by Wi-Fi or Ethernet; so that your software can deliver the content that you have created. Most Digital Signage software enables you to easily create adverts from text; images and logos. Often you can use video and animation effects to make your content more appealing. Some systems allow use of widgets for weather; social media and news too. Others will provide a selection of free or paid templates that give you a head-start in your content-creation. More sophisticated Digital Signage software allows the scheduling of playlists so that you can display different content at different times during the day or week. Generally speaking; the more sophisticated the feature-set you are buying; the more expensive your Digital Signage solution will be. It is remarkable how much you can do with a simple solution. Our top takeaways: Consider carefully what features you really need Start simple: you can always upgrade to a more sophisticated solution later. How much does it cost? The cost of your Digital Signage setup will usually break down into two elements: One-off costs Your upfront investment will generally need to cover your screens; Digital Signage players & any installation and configuration. Sometimes some of these costs are bundled into the recurring costs (see below). Recurring costs Normally you will pay a recurring cost for access to; and use of; the Digital Signage software that runs your system. Sometimes this includes the cost of the players and sometimes not — take care to compare like for like. Recurring costs can be as low as £10/month per screen or ten times that for sophisticated systems. Be sure to check the minimum contract term too; to avoid getting tied into a solution before you have properly evaluated it. Three tips for creating compelling Digital Signage content When designing content for your Digital Signage; normal graphic design principles apply — but there are some specific principles that you should bear in mind too: 1. Address your audience Get your message across in 2–3 seconds; unless it’s a waiting or queuing environment in which case you can provide more depth. 2. Make it dynamic Ads featuring video or animation content perform considerably better than static ads — but be careful not to overdo it! 3. Keep it fresh The beauty of digital signage is the ease with which it can be updated. Make sure you keep your content fresh and varied.

Everything You Need to Know About the Tribune Publishing Cyberattack,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write Everything You Need to Know About the Tribune Publishing Cyberattack PCMag · Follow Published in PC Magazine · 3 min read · Jan 2; 2019 5 Printing operations at the Los Angeles Times; the San Diego Union-Tribune; and all Tribune Publishing newspapers were disrupted over the weekend by a widespread cyberattack; reportedly traced back to the Ryuk ransomware. By Rob Marvin Over the weekend; a cyberattack disrupted print newspaper distribution across the US. The Los Angeles Times said a malware attack on Tribune Publishing’s software systems delayed weekend distribution of the newspaper and affected Tribune publications throughout the country. The print editions of the Baltimore Sun; Capital Gazette; Chicago Tribune; Hartford Courant; and a number of other Tribune-owned papers were published on Saturday without classified ads and death notices; according to the publications. The attack also affected the San Diego Union-Tribune; the South Florida Sun Sentinel; and distribution of The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal; the West Coast editions of which are printed at the company’s LA facility. Distribution of smaller local California papers including the Glendale News Press and Burbank Leader was also affected. A source inside Tribune Publishing told the L.A. Times the company believes the attack originated outside the U.S. and was intended to disable infrastructure rather than steal information. The company sold both the L.A. Times and San Diego Union-Tribune earlier this year; but the newspapers still rely on Tribune Publishing’s production platform and printing networks; the target of the cyberattack. None of the publications’ websites or online editions were affected; and the company said no subscriber personal data was compromised. The company’s official statements stopped short of providing further details about the attack; but anonymous sources told the L.A. Times that the Ryuk ransomware may be a culprit. The same ransomware took down a North Carolina water utility in October. Ryuk; first described by security software provider Check Point over the summer; tends to hit high-value targets that can’t afford major downtime; demanding hefty Bitcoin ransoms. The New York Times said the group behind Ryuk; known as Grim Spider; has already been paid nearly 100 Bitcoin valued at more than $380;000 this month. It’s unclear whether any of that ransom came from Tribune Publishing. According to The New York Times report; Tribune first noticed a malfuctioning server this past Thursday night. It appeared to be contained but then spread throughout the company’s printing software systems on Saturday; debilitating operations and stymying page transmissions to Southern California printing presses. The company was able to resume on-time deliveries on Sunday; but it said the outage and attack were yet to be completely resolved. The company said it has reported the attack to the FBI; and a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security said the agency is also investigating the situation. There has been some debate over the ransomware culprits. Check Point has linked Ryuk to North Korea’s APT Lazarus Group. Security firm CrowdStrike; on the other hand; told The New York Times it believes cybercriminals in Eastern Europe were behind the attack; which may be related to the nefarious TrickBot malware. This year alone; ransomware attacks have been responsible for crippling systems including the Newark and Atlanta city governments; the Port of San Diego; and clinical lab testing company LabCorp. Those attacks are linked back to the SamSam ransomware strain; which the US government has linked to Iran. The reported Tribune Publishing ransomware attack; whether ultimately traced back to North Korea; other nation-state actors; or hacker groups; marks the first known attack on major newspaper printing operations.

Ring In The New Year With Security Tools from MetaCert,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write Ring In The New Year With Security Tools from MetaCert Don’t get blindsided by a scam; MetaCert will keep you safe from phishing attacks. Jeremy Nation · Follow Published in METACERT · 6 min read · Jan 2; 2019 50 Everywhere there’s a buck to me made someone is trying to cheat someone else; and while that unpleasant reality might not leave a good taste in your mouth; MetaCert has your back; with tools that will allow you to differentiate between legitimate web resources and scams. Forging into the new year; whether you’re just getting into cryptocurrency; or you’re a veteran hodler; chances are good you’ve heard about the ripoff schemes plied by malicious actors. Part of the problem lies with a mixture of sophisticated methods used by scammers paralleled with a sentiment of urgency that comes from the fear of missing out. These factors conflate with misinformation campaigns designed to ensnare newcomers to the scene. One of the things throwing fuel on the fire is a basic lack of understanding. People who are just getting inducted into the scene often do not know how to manage public versus private keys; or which cryptocurrency exchanges are the right ones to set up an account at; and how to move their digital assets to a cold storage wallet. This basic lack of understanding means people are likely to ask questions; which makes them targets for malicious actors who use misinformation to socially engineer an attack. Another problem is that supposedly trustworthy sources of information often fail to weed out the scammers. For instance; compromised Twitter accounts; sometimes even those verified by the platform itself; have been known to successfully place promotional ads featuring links to known phishing scams. If people see an advertisement for a cryptocurrency scam as a promoted tweet; they will be more susceptible to believing that type of scam is legitimate; while they may not fall for it immediately; they may later reference that instance and fall for a different scam; misinterpreting the information from seeing a scam in a promoted tweet. Twitter needs to do a better job preventing scams like this from being widely distributed to its users. One hopes that eventually this issue is something that will be managed from the inside out as cryptocurrency systems begin to scale outwards and compete with legacy remittance systems. Once that happens the user interface side is less likely to feature hexadecimal code keys which can be difficult for the human eye to differentiate from another. Until that day comes; you can continue to rely on security tools from MetaCert. An Ecosystem Swarming With Threats After a significant mainstream boom in 2017; nearly every chat service and social media site was crawling with crypto scammers to the point where MetaCert had to take action. Shortly after MetaCert developed tools for Slack that eradicated the phishing on the platform; MetaCert CEO and Founder Paul Walsh accurately predicted that scammers would migrate to another platform; Telegram. Again; MetaCert sprung into action; and created a bot that identifies dangerous resources such as malicious URLs and cryptocurrency addresses associated with phishing campaigns. Today; MetaCert’s powerful tools allow users to easily differentiate between legitimate and dangerous resources at a glance. The Anatomy of the Scam Phishing scams today are often difficult to discern from their legitimate counterparts. In one case a user would have need a microscope to identify a tiny pixel above character to differentiate the scam site from the real one. Other times scammers use automated systems to get a green lock signifying SSL certification on their phishing site; and consumers fall for that. The truth is; without a valid verification system; it’s practically impossible to tell at a glance whether a site is safe or not until it’s too late. Don’t simply trust the padlock! The Green Shield of Trust MetaCert has verified legitimate web resources with a green shield of trust; seen by subscribers to the Cryptonite browser plugin. That means you’ll see the green shield of trust whenever you visit a verified cryptocurrency related website; social media account; wallet provider; and/or cryptocurrency exchange. In 2018 we continued to expand our database of over 10 billion classified uniform resource identifiers across over 60 categories thanks to the participation of our community and our hard working team. In 2019 we intend to expand our verification services beyond crypto to encompass sites also targeted by phishing scammers including mainstream companies; payment portals; and more. Soon the green shield of trust will also signify you’re safe when you’re buying things online; paying bills; or otherwise managing finances through online banking services; so you’ll always know you’re in the right place on the web. Remember; if the shield is black; that means the site hasn’t been verified and might not be trustworthy; so use caution. $150 Worth Of MetaCert Tokens As A Special Bonus Your subscription to Cryptonite today will get you more than a year’s worth of safety. For the first 2;000 subscribers to Cryptonite we’re offering $150 in MetaCert Tokens; to be distributed following the end of our public sale. You’ll know right away if you’re one of the first 2;000 subscribers: To subscribe to Cryptonite now; follow these instructions. Email Security MetaCert is still beta testing our email security tool that is sure to revolutionize the way you see links in your email. Many phishing emails contain links; or images with hyperlinks. MetaCert’s email security tool uses a color coded system to warn you against known threats; or potentially malicious links. Every link that appears in your email will feature a shield beside it; if the shield is green you’re safe; and if the shield is red you know it’s a phishing link. Again; if the shield is black; that means the resource hasn’t been verified; and that you should use extreme caution clicking on it. Sign up for our email security tool for iOS today; and see how we’re changing the way people see links in their email. This report was brought to you by MetaCert. Join the conversation with us on Telegram; and find out why MetaCert is the new shield of trust for web resources. You can also check out our white paper and technical paper; and follow us @MetaCert on Twitter. MetaCert Protocol is decentralizing cybersecurity for the Internet; by defining ownership and URL classification information about domain names; applications; bots; crypto wallet addresses; social media accounts and APIs. The Protocol’s registry can be used by ISPs; routers; Wi-Fi hotspots; crypto wallets and exchanges; mobile devices; browsers and apps; to help address cyber threats such as phishing; malware; brand protection; child safety and news credibility. Think of MetaCert Protocol as the modern version of the outdated browser padlock and whois database combined. Sign up to discover human stories that deepen your understanding of the world.

Mobile apps in 2019–10 trends worth to be highlighted,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write Mobile apps in 2019–10 trends worth to be highlighted Adam Golański · Follow 8 min read · Jan 3; 2019 A year ago; studies by We are social and Hootsuite revealed that the number of internet users worldwide exceeded 4 billion and the number of mobile phone users exceeded 5 billion. The average internet user was supposed to spend six hours a day using devices connected to the Internet — a quarter of his or her life. To sum it up; it would mean that in 2018 humanity spent one billion man-years on the Internet. And there is no evidence that this trend is slowing down. More and more accessible mobile Internet; better and better smartphones make us believe that in 2019 we will be even more actively integrating the Internet into our lives. This will be primarily caused by mobile applications. While a few years ago there was a lot of talk about mobile Web; HTML5 standards; mobile browsers; today it is becoming more and more obvious that this is not the right way to go. Applications have won the users’ hearts; providing more convenient access to information; entertainment; and various practical functionalities. Mobile web became at best just an addition to the applications. Websites viewed on mobile browsers are first and foremost encourage users to install mobile apps. YouTube; Facebook; Reddit; Pornhub; Allegro… Although they still work in the browser; they only show their full potential on the smartphone through their client applications. The same applies to every online shop — it’s great to have a mobile website; but the conversion rate from it is far lower than from a desktop site. Even small e-shops are commissioning mobile apps in the hope that they will find a new home on the smartphone’s start screen. However; it is not only the convenience of the users that have influenced this situation. Another factor was the reduction in the cost of entering the market with a new mobile application. In 2018 only two mobile platforms remained on the market — iOS and Android. Mobile Windows; BlackBerry; Tizen or Firefox OS ceased to have any relevance. So there is no need to worry about them; no need to bear the additional costs of software development. Furthermore; React Native technology has reached maturity; thanks to which it is easy to build a mobile application that will work as well on Android as on iOS. It’s true; React Native has its limitations; but in the case of a typical enterprise or retail apps they’re not noticeable. And on the horizon; you can see one more solution. Wherever the budget is not sufficient even for creating a React Native application; it becomes possible to use Progressive Web Apps. This kind of software is installed directly from websites; without the involvement of app stores. In many cases; Progressive Web Apps can provide users with more or less the same experience as the native app. And most importantly; these apps work well enough not only on Android but also on iOS. With these factors in mind; it is not surprising that revenues from the global mobile apps market (the value of sales in stores and ads emission) are expected to reach almost 190 billion dollars in 2020. So what to expect from mobile apps in 2019? Here are the ten most important trends that we focus on in Matsuu: 1. Chatbots Nowadays more and more users prefer the self-service — this is especially visible in the B2B industry; but also individual customers like independence. Chatbots; acting as virtual assistants in sales applications; turn out to be the solution that will allow the customer to fully automate the contact with the store. According to Statista; the value of the chatbots market is expected to increase by more than a billion dollars in the coming years. They will become part of the normal user experience; their absence will be considered as something bizarre. On the one hand; it is the result of the arrival on the market the generation accustomed to communicators; on the other hand; the development of programming tools that allow the quick integration of chatbots with the existing applications. And due to the progress in artificial intelligence; with each subsequent interaction with the user; mobile apps will provide better and better responses through their chats. 2. Machine learning If we are talking about Artificial Intelligence; we must remember that it affects the progress of not only chatbots but also many other smartphone functionalities. Above all; this means machine learning; which allows the analysis of vast amounts of data to provide the users with a more personalized experience; and the publishers of applications with a better insight into the users’ needs. Speech recognition; image recognition; decision support; searching for the best offers — such solutions will be eagerly used in the new generation of mobile applications in the coming year. Gartner predicts that it will be the most important element of digital business in the coming years; whose value by 2022 will reach 3.9 trillion dollars. 3. Multiplatform development It is true the fact that only Android and iOS remained on the market has significantly reduced the cost of software development; but still; the need for separate software development for two systems constitutes a serious financial barrier for many customers. Fortunately; in the last two years; it became possible to meet the needs of those who do not have at their disposal large budgets thanks to React Native. However; it is obvious that this Facebook-made technology is not sufficient for all kinds of applications. Flutter; Google’s new framework for building visually spectacular multiplatform mobile apps; has no such limitations. With the release of its first stable version in December 2018; a new wave of beautiful and powerful apps is coming; and they can be immediately published on Google Play and App Store. For now; the challenge is to find programmers who are experienced enough with the still little-known Dart language. In this language; the Flutter apps are created and they use a number of its more advanced features. 4. Augmented reality All these virtual reality goggles remain so far a curiosity for the gamers. They are simply too uncomfortable; too impractical to be used anywhere except for some types of games and perhaps a few specialized applications. However; 2019 will; in our opinion; be the year in which mobile applications will be eagerly upgraded with the technology that has grown up on the basis of VR; i.e. Augmented Reality (AR). Pokémon Go was not just a one-time fad. Thanks to the increasing performance of smartphones; it will be possible to create breathtaking mobile apps that supplement reality with additional layers of information on the fly. More and more companies will use AR to improve sales and customer communication. More and more applications will also follow Instagram and Snapchat and will be enhanced with interactive AR components; supported by Apple’s ARKit and Google’s ARCore technologies. This impresses users and is ideal for use in advertising and loyalty campaigns in social media. 5. Mobile payments and wallets Year after year; our shopping habits are changing. We replaced cash with plastic credit cards; and then start replacing them with mobile wallets and cryptocurrencies. This is because easy payments are what customers require from all sales applications. And as mobile shopping has become the primary way for an increasing number of users to buy non-food items; solutions such as Google Pay are improving; allowing us to spend our hard-earned money quickly and safely. Thanks to them; smartphones are turning into our wallets. Now just wait for the digitalization of ID cards… In any case; according to BI Intelligence; by 2020; the value of payments made via mobile devices is expected to amount to 503 billion dollars. 6. Escape from ecosystems Apple has done everything it could to convince users to their FaceTime; even though it does not allow them to communicate with Android users. Building such closed “ecosystems” of software has become a trademark of Cupertino company; even though it has not brought the desired results. iMessage has no chance in terms of popularity with Facebook Messenger or WhatsApp available on every major platform. In this war between Apple and Google; users will increasingly choose multiplatform applications that allow for easy data transfer between systems. The main reason for this change is the desire of the younger generation to try something new from time to time. Who knows; maybe; in the end; iMessage will appear on Android; like Google Duo was released on iPhone? 7. Instant Apps In 2017; Google introduced Instant Apps technology into Google Play — allowing users to try apps from the store immediately without the need to install them. Of course; not every application can be tested in this way; in most cases; these are equivalent to the websites. Google also allows you to easily share them with your friends. As users become more and more impatient; demanding shorter loading times; and 5G networks are still a distant future; apps will be offered more and more often in an instant form; thus eliminating the time needed to download them and install. The effects can be felt immediately — Vimeo has extended its average session time by 130 percent after being released in an instant app form! 8. Serverless backends Serverless infrastructure is a booming pattern of software architecture; which eliminates the need to create and manage your own backends from scratch. Of course; this does not mean that mobile applications will not need servers. The service provider simply becomes responsible for all the essential resources involved in delivering and scaling the application runtime environment. Thanks to such solutions as Google Firebase; we can simply build new software faster and cheaper; and these apps can scale almost without limitations. There is; of course; a side effect here: the software is dependent on Google infrastructure and we’re no longer in full control of application development. But if self-reliance is important; one can always choose the open source serverless solution Parse. In any case; we are going in the direction of API management rather than management of servers. 9. Data in the cloud Internet speed is increasing faster than the amount of memory available in smartphones; especially those more affordable. We can still find devices with 16GB of built-in storage; especially in emerging markets. Meanwhile; more and more applications are storing large amounts of data; taking up space and causing the user to not be able to install further applications anymore. This means that the need to integrate applications with cloud data storage services will increase. Ultimately; we believe that applications will store more and more data; including multimedia data; not locally; but in the clouds. It will also increase the ease of exchanging smartphones for new ones and increase data security. Whatever you say; an ordinary user cannot take care of them as well as a specialized service provider. 10. Motion and localization Bluetooth beacon technology appeared prematurely and failed to make a big impact on the market; but this does not mean that there is no need for this type of solutions. In 2019 an important trend in mobile applications will be motion detection and location. For this purpose; all possible techniques will be used to transmit accurate location data. Gyroscope; accelerometers; magnetometers; and GPS will be complemented with data from Bluetooth; Wi-Fi and 5G; allowing precise modelling of user movement in space; also in enclosed facilities. Motion and location detection apps can be used to pinpoint colleagues; save energy; protect against theft; and are suitable for games (including AR games); fitness; geotagging and navigation applications. These ten trends certainly do not cover the whole issue. In our industry; there are new breakthroughs occurring constantly. Smartphones and their software are solving more and more human problems; changing people’s everyday lives on a scale we could not have imagined in the previous century. We are already carrying out many of the most important tasks with the help of the apps. Shopping; travel; banking; dating; entertainment; news; sports; education; and even health check-ups have all been transformed by the software. What will be the next area of human life that can be changed with mobile applications? We believe that some surprises in this area are inevitable.

Paradigm Shift in Corporate Banking on Blockchain Adoption,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write Paradigm Shift in Corporate Banking on Blockchain Adoption Farhang Maghdeed · Follow Published in The Finterra Publication · 2 min read · Jan 2; 2019 20 Over the past thirty years; central banks focused on fighting inflation globally and have been failing. Given that inflation has been identified as the major culprit in most of the global depression since the 1920’s to today; no wonder most financial institutions have made it their target trying to control and manage it. However; it was the financial crisis of 2008 that led to deeper questioning of economic processes; credit system and debt management. The recession pointed out a gap in the public’ trust in financial institutions and governments due to the lack of transparency and accountability in financial world. The question on everyone’s mind is: will this stop; or it will continue? Are there any solutions out there that can prevent the collapse of financial fundamentals that are built around a centralised system? Not a question with an easy or short answer; but the smart money seems to be on blockchain architecture that is using cutting edge technology to build trust and transparency. Blockchain platform are attracting the attention of financial service sector to its innovative technology that is set to change the future and it has emerged as a new paradigm in the financial industry. In 2016; the World Economic Forum (WEF) predicted that blockchain will revolutionize financial services; and build a solid platform where consumers and producers / buyers and sellers will converge. The financial sector however; is apprehensive considering the technology’s link to cryptocurrencies and evolving blockchain technology use in other sectors. In 2017; the banking sector and remittance industry experienced industry disruptions and large-scale mergers. By the end of the year; a consensus between the banking sector and blockchain technologists were reached. In the first quarter of 2018 several banks started adopting and testing the technology in phases. Decentralised Ledger Technology (DLT) has created the “internet of value” by empowering peer to peer; transparent; immediate and almost free exchanges of value over the internet awakening the banking industry the real possibility of their demise and effectively killing the stranglehold they have on the financial markets; not a pretty thought if you are involved in the finance business. According to Statistics; from 2016 to 2021 it is estimated that blockchain technology is heating the global market aggressively; with the Blockchain industry market reacing 339.5 Million USD in size and is forecast to grow to 2.3 billion USD by 2021. Although banks and financial institutions have always been at the frontline of the technology evolution; it is very interesting to know they are preparing for a true battle. Who will win? Who will emerge triumphant and reap the spoils of war? It’s really too early to tell yet; but for Blockchain the future is bright.

Business models of Self-driving cars — Part 2,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write Business models of Self-driving cars — Part 2 Saurabh Gupta · Follow 6 min read · Jan 2; 2019 12 Image Credit: https://media.wired.com/photos/5a6fbe7d68851b1549e7d280/master/pass/Waymo-Minivan.jpg Update: Part 1 sparked some interesting thoughts on social media and folks raved about interesting ‘car-as-a-service’ subscription offerings such as ‘Clutch’ in Atlanta; Mercedes; BMW; Porsche; Cadillac; and Volvo care starting at $600 per month. Toyota has also announced its plans to roll out a similar service in 2019. There was also a passionate perspective from Tesla/Chevy Cruze owners (or leasees) about the financial virtues of owning an EV. Back to the autonomous car business models. The real “software is eating the world” story of autonomous cars is the ‘Android’ style platform model led by a motley crew of tech players; auto component suppliers; and some innovative automakers. The Apple model of vertical integration is logical for incumbent auto giants and brings in technology capabilities to their current product line. However; a number of savvy companies are expanding their technology platform by licensing it to auto manufacturers. The Autonomous Technology Platform — The “Android” model The idea is pretty simple…Equip a regular car — new or existing with autonomous capabilities — by building a platform that combines the hardware/sensor/Lidars and the artificial intelligence brains. It is similar to buying a Samsung phone which at its heart is running Android O/S. By focusing on autonomous technology platform instead of the entire car; this strategy offers some unprecedented opportunities that have not seen daylight yet. The players here are diverse and fall largely in three different categories. The Young Turks — The first category members are auto ancillary manufacturers and allied industries that have the auto engineering know-how but tend to play at a lower spot in the auto manufacturing value chain. A classic example of this is Delphi/Aptiv. This segment has some interesting potential in the future; especially if/when it goes directly to the consumer. Imagine if they were to offer a hardware/software kit that can be installed in any modern car to make it autonomous. There is a massive incumbent market of non-autonomous cars and probably a lot of those folks would want to modernize their current chariots. With a traditional SAAS model for autonomous software/hardware’s continuing maintenance and an ‘over-the-air’ updates; combined with unlimited in-car wi-fi; auto-insurance etc.; such offerings would probably result in a pretty large market cap business. C hallenge — A lack of direct B2C type service delivery experience; limited understanding of software and digital interaction models may cause their offering to be too engineering like; and not have enough emphasis on end-user experience and ease of usage. The Tech Mongols — With deep technical roots to solve challenges of artificial intelligence and machine learning for autonomous driving; and equally deep pockets; these players are designing the future of transportation. These companies may have nothing to do directly with auto manufacturing but are the classic example of ‘software is eating the world’. Google/Alphabet’s WayMo and Uber fall in this category. Today; these players are focused on extending the current Uber/Lyft model and will upend the taxi market; but it won’t be surprising to see them also extend into the conversion opportunity for modern non-autonomous cars. It would seem more logical for Waymo than Uber to reach out into the existing car market; as an extension of Google’s relationship with users. After all; more data of where you go and what you do is lucrative for marketers — especially of those who are on non-Android devices and cannot be easily tracked. C hallenge — Perhaps the biggest challenge for Waymo/Uber of the world is public perception and their ability to counter the apprehension of too much power in the hands of tech companies. The recent unease with social networks and Silicon Valley companies ever-increasing power is unsettling for politicians and public alike — and may cause a backlash that has nothing to do with the technical superiority of their platform. The Auto Moghuls — If you are one of the largest automakers and have made some decent inroads into the autonomous technology solution space; why not partner with your competitors and add more fuel to the autonomous platform race. GM is embracing this strategy with Honda to infuse more investment into their autonomous platform/newly sprouted start-up called Cruise. By pooling resources; this strategy enables GM and Honda to bring autonomous capabilities to their own vehicles; and also increase the sophistication of the platform itself. With their internal auto engineering expertise and world-class ability to commercialize these technologies on a global scale; Cruise will definitely be a platform to watch out for. In addition; this model lends itself well to the fleet of ‘Robo-taxis’ that GM seems interested in launching. Its the automakers getting in on Uber/Lyft/Waymo’s game. Also; for smaller automakers that do not have the economies of scope and scale for autonomous platforms; such as Subaru; Mazda; Nissan; and others; this is perhaps an attractive club to join. C hallenge — Coopetition or collaborating with competitors comes with its own series of challenges. This business model has several advantages and as long as a clear framework of trust and governance is shared by the players; it can create a significant advantage. However; given the cut-throat competition in the auto market; this is a delicate balance to be maintained. Today’s car related customer service is largely deferred to dealers and other third parties — and it is a well-oiled channel management machine for most of the incumbent automakers. However; in the new world of autonomous cars — especially when they are running on a common platform; how will these services be delivered. Would they a better fit for a centrally managed call center; with sophisticated software integrations with the vehicles’ sensors and diagnostics that require a different type of skill set. How will it affect the brand perception and quality of service? It ain’t an oil change…Autonomous car users of tomorrow will want to press a button and be redirected to someone who can help with their car’s software — which may be rather different from the services that a dealer offers. Summary: The autonomous platform participants of the ‘Android’ model would need to significantly differentiate their end customer’s user experience to stay competitive in the marketplace. One can argue that cars themselves are the differentiation — as the non-autonomous ones are today. However; as we move into an era where we will drive less and tap on screens more; designing an end-user experience that hides the generic autonomous platform and offers a pleasant and branded experience will be key. The challenge with the ‘Android’ business model for autonomous vehicles is similar to the one that exists with Android phones — a clear lack of differentiation in the digital experience. As a technologist; it is a great era to be living in. As these tectonic shifts occur; we can merely marvel at the advancements that are occurring at a dizzying pace.

16 Free Online Courses On Emerging Technologies and Global Innovation that Will Prepare You for the Future of Work,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write 16 Free Online Courses On Emerging Technologies and Global Innovation that Will Prepare You for the Future of Work Charlie Oliver · Follow Published in TECH 2025 · 15 min read · Jan 2; 2019 -- In the two years since we first launched Tech 2025; back in January 2017; we’ve learned that the primary reason people attend our events on any given topic is because they are curious about the topic or a particular aspect of the topic that we highlight in our event marketing. Many of our attendees aren’t necessarily advanced in (or very knowledgeable about) the technologies we cover. They come to us curious; wanting to see something that sparks their internal; creative compass — even if they have no idea what that “something” might be. It’s safe to say that we’re all a bit overwhelmed with the number of disruptive emerging technologies emerging and developing simultaneously; each one promising to change global industries and the very nature of our reality in a mere next ten years: AI; machine learning; AR/VR/XR; 3D printing; autonomous vehicles; gene-editing biotech; robots; automation — oy! Where to begin?! Imagining the future and your place in it has never been so complicated. Knowledge is power; but curiosity is queen. As hard as it may sometimes be (we’re all busy and eternally distracted); in order to learn about the true potential impact of technology and to find our place in the ecosystem; we must feed our curiosity by constantly and substantively learning about the systems and ideas that are at the core of emerging technologies; including how global innovation happens; morals and ethics of businesses; corporate management and structure; societies and social science; etc. These technologies are challenging us to redefine who we are and what we want. The obvious question is: who are we and what do we really want? Don’t let your curiosity go to waste. It’s your most powerful tool. It’s the anchor that will steady you in turbulent times as technologies and big ideas come and go. Learn and relearn what you thought you already knew. Revisit old concepts; learn new ones; and challenge current systems and ways of thinking. You don’t necessarily have to jump into the deep-end of the pool by taking expensive; months-long; courses in AI and machine learning that will require technical expertise you don’t have or necessarily want right now. You can start the new year learning about concepts at the core of emerging technologies or the industries that are adopting them. With this knowledge; regardless of the market volatility; you’ll be able to think through what’s happening now; how the latest developments might impact your business; and what’s coming next. I’ve gathered a short list of free online courses that helps us to see “the big picture” and focus on the problems emerging technologies are being created to solve; as opposed to the technology itself (and even the problems that are arising as we implement technologies like algorithmic bias). I’ll be adding more to this list in parts 2 and 3 of this series in the coming weeks. Invite people in your network (friends; family; coworkers) to join you on this journey. It’s one well worth taking and a great way to kick off the new year! 1. International Leadership and Organizational Behavior Università Bocconi on Coursera Started (started 24th Dec; 2018) We live in an increasingly interconnected world and the technologies of the near future will make us even more interconnected. As China; the US and other nations race to become leaders in AI; understanding international leadership and organizational behavior during technological transition will become crucial. This course is a great place to start. Course Description: Leaders in business and non-profit organizations increasingly work across national borders and in multi-cultural environments. You may work regularly with customers or suppliers abroad; or be part of a globally dispersed cross-functional team; or an expatriate manager on an international assignment. You may be a member of a global online community; or a development aid worker collaborating with an international network of partner organizations. In all of these contexts; your effectiveness as a leader depends on how well you understand and are able to manage individual and collective behaviors in an intercultural context. In this course… we’ll explore the theory and practice of international and intercultural leadership and organizational behavior. 2. Tales from the Genome Presented by 23andme The world was horrified by the news that He Jiankui (a Chinese scientist) created the world’s first babies genetically modified with CRISPR (twin girls with a potential third baby on the way) and; if that weren’t enough to sound alarms; his work was (according to fellow scientists); sloppy and full of errors (Is the CRISPR baby controversy the start of a terrifying new chapter in gene editing?). The global science community is still grappling to understand the implications of this shocking story. Here’s how you can begin to understand the technology; why what Jiankui did was considered to be so dangerous; and how you can participate in the discussion — take this course! After you take this course; consider taking this edX course; Analyze Your Genome! Course Description: This course is a journey into the biology of the human genome and will highlight the scientific; social; and personal perspectives of people living with a variety of traits. You will learn about fundamental principles of inheritance; gene expression; mutation and variation; development of simple and complex biological traits; human ancestry and evolution; and the acquisition of personal genetic information. By the end of this course; you will be able to read and understand genetic information available from personal genetics services such as 23andMe. 3. Ethics and Law in Data and Analytics Presented by Microsoft (started December 31) The need for taking this course (and its potential benefits) is pretty self-explanatory. As AI and machine learning technologies take over every part of our society; contentious issues surround ethics and fairness will grow (particularly in corporate and government sectors). Here’s a great introduction to the legal framework around the topic. There are NO prerequisites for this course. Any and everyone can participate. Course Description: Analytics and AI are powerful tools that have real-word outcomes. Learn how to apply practical; ethical; and legal constructs and scenarios so that you can be an effective analytics professional. Corporations; governments; and individuals have powerful tools in Analytics and AI to create real-world outcomes; for good or for ill. Data professionals today need both the frameworks and the methods in their job to achieve optimal results while being good stewards of their critical role in society today. In this course; you’ll learn to apply ethical and legal frameworks to initiatives in the data profession. You’ll explore practical approaches to data and analytics problems posed by work in Big Data; Data Science; and AI. You’ll also investigate applied data methods for ethical and legal work in Analytics and AI. 4. Internet Giants: The Law and Economics of Media Platforms The University of Chicago (started December 31) Without a doubt; 2018 was the year of “Techlash” where big tech companies were challenged on their technologies; ethics and morals; by governments around the world; consumer advocacy groups; and even their own employees. How this all ends is anyone’s guess. We’ll be exploring this topic extensively at Tech 2025 this year. Here’s a great course that will lay a solid foundation for learning about how tiny startups become mega-platforms and achieve global dominance. Course Description: This seven-week course will explore the relationship between law and technology with a strong focus on the law of the United States with some comparisons to laws around the world; especially in Europe. Tech progress is an important source of economic growth and raises broader questions about the human condition; including how culture evolves and who controls that evolution. Technology also matters in countless other ways as it often establishes the framework in which governments interact with their citizens; both in allowing speech and blocking it and in establishing exactly what the boundaries are between private life and the government. And technology itself is powerfully shaped by the laws that apply in areas as diverse as copyright; antitrust; patents; privacy; speech law and the regulation of networks. This course will cover 7 topics: Microsoft: The Desktop vs. The Internet; Google Emerges (and the World Responds); Smartphones; Nondiscrimination and Network Neutrality; The Day the Music Died?; Video: Listening and Watching; The Mediated Book. 5. Human Space Flight: an Introduction KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm Elon Musk is promising to get us to Mars by 2025. Whether he will or won’t; the fact is; we’re headed to Mars one way or another regardless of who gets us there first (and it will be sooner than later). The privatization of space travel is creating opportunities for entrepreneurs to participate in space travel like never before. And companies like Space X and Virgin Galactic are accepting space tourists for the lucky few who can afford it. This course offers a great overview of the history of human space flight. If you want to be inspired by space tech; this course will give you that spark!

Exploring Basic Income in a Changing Economy Teach-Out University of Michigan (2–4 hours to complete) We did an event on universal basic income in 2017; Silicon Valley; Universal Basic Income and the Future of Work; to explore how Silicon Valley was embracing basic income as a possible (if not temporary or limited) solution to the economic hardship that will likely arise from technological disruption like automation. Back then; hopes were high. Like so many other stories in emerging tech last year; this one came crashing back down to reality as cities around the world that had initially launched Basic Income pilot programs to test its potential; pulled their test program abruptly and early including Ontario and Finland. In an article early last year; the publication Motherboard; cried foul: Basic Income Is Being Set Up to Fail. But just because early trials are failing (for whatever reason) that doesn’t mean Basic Income is dead. Quite the contrary; like the emerging technologies experiencing a cold 2019; UBI is likely going through growth pains as societies globally try to figure out what economic model will work. This short course will offer a great overview and food for thought! Course Description: The United States social safety net is a complex system with many programs and often difficult eligibility requirements. Many of these programs only deliver in-kind aid (not cash) to people living in poverty; a lot of whom can fall through the cracks and can’t make ends meet. Basic income; the idea of providing people with a minimal level of cash support on a consistent basis; remains a point of debate in the United States and beyond. In this Teach-Out; you will join leading experts to explore the emerging idea of basic income and other associated social safety net programs. 8. Unethical Decision Making in Organizations: A seminar on the dark side of the force University of Lausanne (Switzerland) Course Description: This course teaches how narrow frames and strong contexts can push good people towards unethical decisions and how they can protect themselves and their organization against ethical blindness. The goal of this course is to empower the participants to analyze the risks of unethical or illegal behavior that might be triggered by powerful contexts. It draws from various disciplines such as management; psychology; sociology; philosophy; and literature; in order to learn what these disciplines contribute to a better understanding of unethical behavior. The course also analyzes some of the most prominent organizational scandals of the recent decades through the lenses of these disciplines. 9. How to Change the World Wesleyan University So you want to change the world? This course is cut and dry — and plenty thought-provoking. Nothing is every as easy as it seems; least of all; changing the world. This is a good place to start. Course Description: How can we use the things we share in common to address some of the most challenging problems facing the world? This course examines issues concerning poverty; the environment; technology; health care; gender; education and activism to help us understand better how to initiate positive change. 10. Transmedia Storytelling: Narrative worlds; emerging technologies; and global audiences The University of New South Whales (starts January 2) The future will be defined by both technologists and storytellers (among others; of course). This course will provide an overview of storytelling across platforms using various technologies — including the challenges of working with new technologies (AR/VR/XR) to tell stories created for traditional media. Transmedia storytelling is the practice of designing; sharing; and participating in a cohesive story experience across multiple traditional and digital delivery platforms — for entertainment; advertising and marketing; or social change. How do the professionals develop such expansive narratives? How do they ensure that each element stays true to the original story? How do they innovatively use different technologies to share the stories; grow audiences and create an active and involved community of fans? More and more; we are also engaging with elements or franchises of larger and more complex stories across a much more diverse range of platforms like interactive web experiences; social media communities; mobile devices; theme parks; and even augmented and virtual reality. A major challenge that current and future storytellers face is being able to engage different audiences in a story that is seamlessly told across all of these different platforms. 11. Financing and Investing in Infrastructure Università Bocconi (started December 24) Nations across the world are preparing to upgrade their old; dilapidated infrastructures to Smart Cities of the future and; as a result; will not only be preparing for emerging technologies and the challenges they will bring; but they are also looking for ways to fund major infrastructure upgrades. This course is a great primer for understanding where the money will come from to build Smart Cities. Course Description: Learn how debt and equity can be used to finance infrastructure investments and how investors approach infrastructure investments! According to the OECD; the global infrastructure investment requirement by 2030 for transport; electricity generation; transmission & distribution; and water & telecommunications totals to 71 trillion dollars. This figure represents about 3.5% of the annual World GDP from 2007 to 2030. Traditionally investments in infrastructure were financed using public sources. However; severe budget constraints and inefficient management of infrastructure by public entities have led to an increased involvement of private investors in the business. The course focuses on how private investors approach infrastructure projects from the standpoint of equity; debt; and hybrid instruments. 12. An Introduction to Consumer Neuroscience & Neuromarketing Copenhagen Business School (starts January 21) Technologies like AI; machine learning and VR/AR have already begun to dramatically change how consumers shop and how brands deliver experiences to them. One of the biggest problems innovation and marketing teams face is understanding which technologies to implement to engage consumers; how to do it smartly; and what to with the data. This course will help anyone looking to answer these questions understand consumer behavior according to new neuroscience research. Course Description: How do we make decisions as consumers? What do we pay attention to; and how do our initial responses predict our final choices? To what extent are these processes unconscious and cannot be reflected in overt reports? This course will provide you with an introduction to some of the most basic methods in the emerging fields of consumer neuroscience and neuromarketing. You will learn about the methods employed and what they mean. You will learn about the basic brain mechanisms in consumer choice; and how to stay updated on these topics. The course will give an overview of the current and future uses of neuroscience in business. 13. Supply Chain Management: A Learning Perspective Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (starts January 2) Our event last year (The Last Mile: an $80 Billion Global Logistics Problem and the Blockchain Solution) which reviewed how startup Fr8 is using blockchain technology to change last-mile logistics and supply chain management for the better; offered great insights into this topic. With e-commerce giants like Amazon and Walmart in fierce competition to define and dominate supply chains in the future; and technologies like automation; autonomous vehicles and blockchain set to disrupt our entire global supply chain; this course is an ideal foundation for learning about supply chain management before delving into learning about how technology will disrupt them. Course Description: As a human being; we all consume products and/or services all the time. This morning you got up and ate your breakfast; e.g.; eggs; milk; bread; fresh fruits; and the like. After the breakfast; you drove your car to work or school. At your office; you used your computer; perhaps equipped with 27” LCD monitor. During your break; you drank a cup of coffee and played with your iPhone. So on and so forth. You probably take it for granted that you can enjoy all of these products. But if you take a closer look at how each of these products can be made and eventually delivered to you; you will realize that each one of these is no short of miracle. In this course; we want to understand fundamental principles of value creation for the consumers or the market. We try to answer questions like how the product or service is made; how the value-creating activities or functions are coordinated; who should play what leadership roles in realizing all these; and so on. As our course title hints; we approach all of these issues from a learning perspective; which is dynamic in nature and emphasizes long-term capability building rather than short-term symptomatic problem solving. 14. Electric Cars: Policy Delft University of Technology Electric cars aren’t just the future; they’re the present! If you’ve been wondering what all of the Tesla/electric battery hoopla is about; take this 4-week course. It offers a thorough overview of electric car space from the policy perspective (something that doesn’t get nearly as much coverage in the media and Elon Musk’s tweets). Course Description: Learn about the role of public policy in steering technological innovation and infrastructural change toward zero-emission mobility. Electric cars are more than a novel means of mobility. They have been recognized as an essential building block of the energy transition. Fulfilling their promise will imply a significant change in the technical; digital and social dimensions of transport and energy infrastructure. As the massive adoption of electric mobility will deeply change our society and our individual routines; government intervention is called for. If you are interested in learning about the roles of government in shaping the transition towards electric mobility and renewable energy systems; then this is the course for you. In this course; you will explore the promise of electric mobility from different public policy perspectives and different levels of government; and learn how they interact. After completing this course; you will be able to assess a policy plan to support the introduction of electric cars and make a motivated choice between alternative policy instruments. In the final week; the course will be concluded by connecting the different track perspectives. 15. Understanding Research Methods University of London International Programmes (starts January 21) With the launch of our Mission AI program last Summer; Tech 2025 has made a firm commitment to helping our members to learn about (and participate in) AI research. We believe strongly that; while not everyone will necessary want to (or needs to) learn how to develop AI and machine learning technologies to be part of developing it; everyone benefits (including the entire AI ecosystem) if the public is as least reasonably fluent in understanding how research is done; funded; and used. We’ve already hosted several events on this topic including; Introduction to Artificial Intelligence Research and Preparing for Battle Against Malicious Artificial Intelligence. Both events were packed with people eager to learn the latest research. This course is a great introduction to research methods and the (academic) research ecosystem. Course Description: The course will appeal to those of you who require an understanding of research approaches and skills; and importantly an ability to deploy them in your studies or in your professional lives. In particular; this course will aid those of you who have to conduct research as part of your postgraduate studies but do not perhaps have access to research methods courses; or for those of you who feel you would like additional support for self-improvement. No prior knowledge or experience in research is required to take this course and as such; the course is for everyone. In 2015; the course was nominated for the prestigious Guardian University Award for its innovative approach to online learning. 16. Understanding Diversity and Inclusion Purdue University (starts January 7) With Silicon Valley and tech companies facing increasing backlash for their lack of diversity and inclusion policies; and the demand for companies in general to be more inclusive and culturally sensitive; taking a course like this seems like a good bet regardless of your background. This is a discussion that will undoubtedly stay at the forefront of the tech and business industry in the coming years as they grapple with developing technologies that are inclusive and representative of the true fabric of society. Course Description: Learn how to create a more inclusive world. Many things contribute to an individual’s identity; including race; ethnicity; gender; age; appearance; religion; gender identity; sexual orientation; education; and political beliefs. These things; and more; are what make each of us different. So how can we learn to embrace these differences; and celebrate them? Or to put it in a different way — how can we explore and welcome diversity? This course will help you develop your knowledge and understanding of diversity; equipping you to create more inclusive and open environments that are welcome to all. Topics covered include: Phases of diversity dexterity; Attitudes; skills; and knowledge supporting diversity; Unconscious biases; Ethnocentric and ethno-relative mindsets; Elements of diversity and inclusion.

6 Fast Growing Ecommerce Trends to Utilize in 2019,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write 6 Fast Growing Ecommerce Trends to Utilize in 2019 CommentSold · Follow Published in GoBeyond.AI: E-commerce Magazine · 5 min read · Jan 2; 2019 56 What are some can’t miss strategies and technologies to drive growth in the new year? For 2019; we’ll see an uptick in both emerging selling techniques and established technology that are must-haves for growing businesses. Here are 8 fast growing trends you should utilize asap! 1. Mobile Apps Mobile apps are here to stay and to continue their explosive growth. Each year we see a rise of mobile app usage. 2019 will be no different. Brands are using mobile apps to better serve customers with an undistracted shopping experience and a vehicle for sending personalized messages through push notifications. It seems to be well received. According to a report from Statista; by the year 2020; mobile apps are expected to generate $188.9 billion as global revenue. For e-commerce apps; in particular; consumers spend 8x more than on traditional selling channels. If your brand is considering a mobile app; now’s time to get on board. Trending GoBeyond.ai articles: 1. Best Practices for Managing E-Commerce Customer Service 2. Top 15 Magento 2 Extensions For Your E-Commerce Site 3. How Free Influencers Took My Brand To Global Success 4. The Coming Disruption to E-Commerce Search 2. Live Sales The effectiveness of video marketing is not new. However; live video has been making waves in the world of e-commerce. The introduction of shoppable video has us prepared for a full-blown tsunami of popularity in the new year. Facebook Live; in particular; has given brands a new way to show brand personality; build true fan connection; and provide that coveted human connection. Facebook Live has given retailers a way to show up for a broad audience; increasing brand reach; engagement; and overall sales. How can you make your live video shoppable? Cue comment selling. 3. Comment Selling Comment Selling is not new; but it is a young and budding trend. Brands have already seen the necessity and value of having a social media presence. However; they may not have seen the burgeoning opportunity of monetizing their social media following. Comment selling marries social media and e-commerce by allowing customers to purchase directly through comment claims on Facebook and Instagram. Comment selling possesses an undeniable appeal with its power to drive peer to peer marketing; cultivate brand loyalty; and attract new customers quickly and effortlessly. Businesses of all sizes can use comment selling to bolster sales and drive customer engagement. To make it really work for scaling businesses; it helps to implement tools that will automatically send invoices straight to your customer’s inbox or messenger as soon as a comment claim is made. 4. Unified eCommerce Platforms Modern customers make purchasing decisions over multiple touchpoints — online; offline; via mobile and on social channels. Businesses using 4 or more digital channels will outperform those using single or dual channels by 300%. However; businesses need a way to connect all these channels to a single hub for easier management and better customer experiences. Basically; one tool to handle them all. According to a survey by Boston Retail Partners; 81% of retailers will deploy a unified commerce platform to support commerce through all channels by the end of 2020. Expect to see a rise in these platforms and strong unions between social media selling; webstores; mobile app; and brick & mortar in 2019. 5. Brick-and-Click Brick-and-Click is a business model in which a has both a physical and online presence with blending of the two through a number of engaging personalized tools and services. This method also utilizes a single inventory so there can be a smooth transition between both brick & mortar and online channels without overselling. 6. Automation Automation has already started making profound impacts on the business world and we see no end to its rise in popularity. A study by Supply Management stated that by 2019; 72% of enterprises would be using automation to reduce costs; improve productivity; increase compliance; and shorten transaction times. Automation can manage a multitude of tasks such as invoicing; re-targeting ads; marketing emails; and much more on autopilot. Not only does this lend to labor cost savings; but it also gives rise to improvements in productivity and accuracy. With automation freeing up business owners; they can invest more of their time in business strategy or simply have the ability to get their nights and weekends back. Do it all with one; simple tool.

2019,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write 2019 William Freedman · Follow 4 min read · Jan 2; 2019 4 Sue me for not making my 2019 predictions until after the start of the year. Proscribed by my ethnicity from ever running on time; I just finally got around to putting up my new calendar. Anyway; here’s Your Humble Correspondent’s forecast for the next 363 days in all things blockchain-adjacent. For the record; this isn’t the calendar I just hanged on my fridge. 1902 Justus van Lieberg Trade Card Calendar front. Source: David Berry. When other investments turn sour; crypto will taste sweeter and sweeter. You heard a lot about the stock market’s losing year; but it was really just a regression to the mean after 2017’s profit party. So I think the indices will track upward this year — slowly; measuredly upward. Stocks will be boring. Bonds might be more interesting; but that’s not a compliment. As yield curves flatten and perhaps invert; there’ll be a disincentive to fund long-term projects; which is economic kryptonite. Prediction: Money will flow into crypto as a hedge on the bigger money that flows into cash. Vocabulary will improve. Malta’s regulators distinguish between cryptocurrencies; security tokens and utility tokens. Other regulators will catch up. And the industry will then catch up to the regulators because what gets measured gets done. Everyone will be scrupulous to define what it is they’re trying to do with their ICO or STO. Regulation will move forward; but un-regulation will move forwarder. Sovereign governments would be committing malpractice if they didn’t monitor the crypto space for KYC; AML; ATF and (especially) tax evasion concerns. So exchanges like Coinbase; which scrupulously adhere to all these standards; will continue to thrive by being a safe haven for institutional investors and other solid citizens who want to be — or at least appear — completely aboveboard with their crypto transactions. But let’s remember that “crypto” means “hidden;” and it was the whole Austrian-school; libertarian; borderline anarchical sentiment that fueled its adoption. Some people will still want to buy heroin straight from the poppy farmer. Others will want to transfer money to family in countries that don’t play nice with others. And still others will say it’s none of anyone’s goddamn business what I do with my money — it’s my money. For them; decentralized exchanges which offer enhanced privacy at the risk of running afoul of regulators will grow vigorously in offshore havens. Those who want to demonstrate compliance will; but those who don’t won’t. Putting paid to credit cards. Visa; MasterCard and American Express aren’t going anywhere; but they’re in for some competition via blockchain. Decentralized credit will emerge as a major use case for the technology. This will lower the cost per transaction at just the time when Lightning Network improves bandwidth enough to handle all the processing required. Credit card issuers won’t be measurably hurt by blockchain workarounds in the short term; but they will have to respond somehow. Money will relocate. It’s getting harder to make a living in financial services in London or Zurich. This isn’t just a cryptocurrency issue; although British and Swiss regulatory missteps and political ill will have been revealed in this space more starkly than elsewhere. Such digital asset-friendly venues as Malta; Singapore and the United Arab Emirates are likely to benefit from Old Money enclaves’ inability to keep up. Technology remains unpredictable. So I won’t attempt to predict it. What I’m confident in; though; is this: Blockchain will converge with gaming; machine learning and virtual/augmented reality to provide offerings by the end of the year that are unforeseeable at the beginning; meanwhile; the energy requirements of mining will spur improvements in efficiency and renewable sourcing. China has been sandbagging all this time; and that’s about to end. China will finally put an end to the charade that it has any reservations about crypto. Beijing would’ve ideally liked to keep the game going for a while longer; but the trade war — which it’s losing (I’m no Trump partisan; but a fact’s a fact) — is forcing its hand. By the end of the year; China will have legal centralized exchanges; tolerated offshore exchanges; more DLT patents than any other country; blockchain integrated into its currently sketchy and inefficient debt market; crypto pay options on all its leading e-commerce sites and maybe-just-maybe its own central bank digital currency (possibly developed by GXChain). Feel free to have a laugh at all this a year from now; but be sure to give me a couple days’ grace time. Sign up to discover human stories that deepen your understanding of the world.

A Brief History On The Evolution of E-Commerce,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write A Brief History On The Evolution of E-Commerce Pozess · Follow 2 min read · Jan 2; 2019 -- The ‘90s-early ’00s In August 1994; 21-year-old entrepreneur and creator of NetMarket; Dan Kohn; sold a CD to a friend who lived hundreds of miles away. This was a revolutionary moment in the history of ecommerce; as it came to be known as the first purchase made over the internet and the first purchase to be protected by encrypted technology. That same year; a 30 year old Jeff Bezos quit his Wall Street job in hopes of starting an internet company; and Amazon.com was created. The company grew quickly; and in 1999; Time Magazine named Jeff Bezos “Person of the Year” for popularizing online shopping. Almost 25 years later; Amazon is the biggest online retailer in the US. In 1995; Pierre Omidyar founded the P2P retail site; ebay.com. The “auction”-style business model changed the way people shop at the turn of the century by allowing people to bid on items that spoke to them. In 2003; Apple introduced the iTunes store and by 2004; iTunes had sold 100 million songs. iTunes was revolutionary in that it aided in the acceptance and expansion of social sharing — people could now easily share and suggest their favorite music to friends over the internet. Why The Online Migration? According to the US Census Bureau; as of 2016; 89% of US households have a computer in the home (up from 36.6% in 1997). In fast paced societies such as our own; the internet provides a convenience factor — whether that’s to research prices; or to purchase an item straight from a website with the click of a button. For consumers; there are also endless possibilities when shopping online — the internet knows no boundaries. Pozess and the Future of Ecommerce Pozess promises to continue the online shopping evolution. The blockchain-powered platform empowers the consumer to control the marketplace by sharing their favorite brands with the community while discovering and shopping new products they never knew existed. Social sharing plus the feeling of discovery make shopping fun and interactive; and put virtually unlimited choices of luxury fashion and lifestyle products in the hands of the consumer. We saw the history of ecommerce progress quickly with encrypted technologies and simple social sharing across the internet. The future of ecommerce lies in a cross between blockchain; social sharing; and consumer-controlled content; and Pozess is excited to be at the forefront of this revolution.

Water Challenges Have Created Extraordinary Opportunities,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write Water Challenges Have Created Extraordinary Opportunities Greg Johnson · Follow 3 min read · Jan 3; 2019 Quiet as kept; we are facing a water crisis in the U.S. that’s being inflamed by a serious innovation deficit in water infrastructure. It can be solved; but only through the intersection of new technologies and fresh approaches with status-quo establishments in the water sector. Easier said than done; but what a huge opportunity. All things considered; urban water management sits low on the “environmental urgency” totem pole. A dangerous combination of institutional risk-aversion; paltry investment in new technology; and artificially low water prices factor into this lethargy. Meanwhile; urbanization; the decay of century old infrastructure; and unpredictable weather patterns are straining urban water systems to the brink of failure. The Key to Climate Resiliency: Innovation It used to be that we could rely on past data to determine groundwater supplies or the potential for flooding in a given area. Those days are long gone. A changing climate is a present reality that has everything to do with our future water security. In 2017; extreme weather cost the U.S. $300 billion. New scientific research shows that ten times more Americans are at risk of being flooded out by rivers within the next 20 years; even if greenhouse emissions are completely and immediately curbed. If water security comes down to how cities address this new normal; old path-dependent approaches will prove disastrous. Knowing that current water infrastructure in the U.S. is nearing the end of its useful life; utilities are hurtling toward $700 Billion in new spending on water projects. This is an unprecedented opportunity for new approaches to be adopted by the industry. Fortunately; paradigm-shifting technologies are being (and have been) developed in each cog of the urban water cycle. Bold new material technologies in permeable paving for stormwater infrastructure; distributed water technologies; potable water reuse; and energy recovery from wastewater all show tremendous promise. These could be game-changers at scale; improving the physical structure and financial future for urban water systems…If given the chance. Financing the Future of Water: Institutional path-dependence is but one barrier for promising technologies. The other obvious barrier is the lack of private investment in the development and deployment these technologies. In a vicious circle; the industry that most needs new technologies repels the industry that invests in new technologies — venture capital. Herd mentality on top of herd mentality. Normally; promising startups turn to venture capital to finance growth. But in a dislocated (albeit; huge) industry with slow sales cycles and regulatory sluggishness; it turns out that venture capital is inherently at odds with water startups. Ironically; this probably bodes well for startups in the space. While institutional investors play follow the leader and pile into more marketable environmental plays; innovative water technologies will be backed by new financing mechanisms that allow them to be developed; launched; and deployed in ways that can be truly impactful. It is my feeling that we are entering a truly disruptive period in water infrastructure. Regulatory policy-making is getting lapped by technological advances and new startup financing mechanisms like equity crowdfunding are finding their footing. The truth is; real innovation finds its way around entrance barriers. And when outdated institutional factors influence decision making — even when a new technology demonstrates the massive potential to improve an existing issue — disruption looms. Recall; we all used to hail taxi cabs. Sign up to discover human stories that deepen your understanding of the world. Free Distraction-free reading. No ads.

A few happy science moments from 2018,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write A few happy science moments from 2018 nanomolar · Follow 2 min read · Jan 2; 2019 As we welcome in 2019; we leave behind a year that has come with exceptional scientific breakthroughs that will leave a smile on our face well into this New Year. Although the battle against Alzheimer still has a long way to go; with no effective cures on the market and no promising results yet for drugs designed to slow down the onset of the disease; researchers can at least now hope to detect the disease decades before its onset. Dr. Randall Bateman´s team at Washington University School of Medicine is developing a quick inexpensive amyloid beta blood test that can identify patients long before they start developing the symptoms. Identifying and treating patients sooner might help develop preventative measures. Another breakthrough test; developed at the University of Queensland; is a universal cancer test that can detect traces of any cancer in a blood sample in 10 minutes. The test is based on the discovery that cancer DNA sticks to metal surfaces in a different way to healthy DNA; which is much more heavily methylated. This translates into a colorimetric test in which gold nanoparticles interacting with the patient´s DNA will allow the detection of cancer DNA. Unfortunately 2018 has also opened our eyes about the great problem the planet faces due to pollution with plastic. On the brighter side; many talented researchers are racing against the clock to solve the issue. And as an example; a new enzyme is being developed to break down PET; which could allow plastic bottles to be fully recycled back into new bottles; limiting the need to produce new plastic. It will be exciting to see 2019 unfold and reveal new technologies and scientific breakthroughs that may hold the key to solving some of our society´s biggest problems. Happy New Year!

My Simple Approach to Testing,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write My Simple Approach to Testing itsnathandaily · Follow 2 min read · Jan 3; 2019 Photo by freestocks.org on Unsplash Start with the APIs I try to understand how each exposed API works and how it connects to the backend. I see it as a big black box unit that accepts inputs and sends back responses. Questions I ask myself are: What are the APIs and how do they get called? Is it possible to emulate the entire platform from the API layer; using a tool like Postman or even in Java. Write behavioral; positive and negative API tests in postman. I try to get as much coverage as possible. Finally; I automate the API tests. The User Interface I design the UI tests from the acceptance criteria and collaborate with the developers ahead of time. In the tests; I include negative; boundary and edge cases. In addition to the designed tests; I manually test the UI in exploratory style (mostly to discover edge cases). I add any test case I find to the set of test cases already drafted. I ensure the entire UI test cases are automated. Stubbing and mocking When testing a particular UI feature; I try to stub out the back end (To be more succinct; I stub out the API that is called from the UI). I do this to strictly focus on functionality. For the web and app UIs; I use Apimocker to create localhost server to which I would conveniently programme to give me the desired response that I want and I would use Charles Proxy’s remapping tool to redirect the API call and return the response that the UI needs. Automated Tests When writing automated tests- I design them to be configurable. Especially when it comes to the following Page objects Web and App elements Different Test environments Different types of test data And anything else I can think off. Making the automated tests configurable can be cumbersome to set up; but it goes a long way. People looking to add to or understand the test code always appreciate this. Testing Performance and Stress I like to operate performance and stress tests from the API layer rather than from the UI. I use JMeter but there are so many other tools that can be used to do this. Key performance indicators I use are the following Response times for each input (including end to end tests) The maximum number of users at a specific time that would crash the application. This part can be broken down to users per specific function. Determine what you would like your maximum to be and optimize.

How Blockchain makes our life easier ?,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write How Blockchain makes our life easier ? EurocoinPay.io · Follow 4 min read · Jan 2; 2019 50 The path since the appearance of Bitcoin Blockchain; it’s been a long way since the Bitcoin developed and counterparts appear to capture the attention of the global masses and financial industry. Blockchain guarantees traceability If we look at the distribution chain as we know it; it has multiple actors and steps involved that are almost always at very distant points. It is necessary to carry out multiple procedures and formalities of all kinds (departures; transports; imports; traceability; deliveries; invoicing; etc.) which for their guarantee require adequate follow-up. For the most part; companies and organisations do not offer transparency in this sense and even manipulate it. Blockchain is presented as the real solution for the digitalization of the supply chain. Traceability is synonymous with knowing the origin of a product and being able to follow its course in the different steps of the transformation and distribution chain; without being manipulated. With Blockchain it´s programmable; reliable and allows to obtain information in real time with operations carried out . What for? In order to be able to act as quickly as possible in the event of an incident. These characteristics turn it as a guarantee of quality for the companies; especially in the food industry. We have seen it in the campaign for a large supermarket in Spain. The inviolability of Blockchain gives a much more convincing value. With the adoption of Blockchain; the stakeholders in the chain cannot alter it; since it is insured and jointly owned by several entities. In fact; contains information is more than reliable and cannot be questioned as it isn’t managed by a single actor that may have economic or political interests. It allows interested parties to gain operational efficiency; and above all to gain brand image in the eyes of consumers. Blockchain and the Cryptocurrencies When we talk about Bitcoin or Cryptocurrencies; we have to say that they are means of exchange like any other currency; the natural evolution of Fiat money to cryptocurrency; but the great difference is that the cryptocurrencies does not depend on any Central Bank or Government that controls their issuance. They have a value in traditional currencies: can be exchanged for dollars; euros or any other currency at any time; what’s more; you are able to to trade with cryptocurrencies and make the conversion to Fiat money and vice versa. The participants can use it across the multiple platforms; globally. The incorporation of Bitcoin as a means of payment An alternative that is increasingly present in the street as a means of payment is that among the reasons why the popularity of the Cryptocurrency has increased considerably. First of all its safety; economical; decentralize and without intermediaries. Eurocoinpay; is a platform that is working to integrate traditional financial systems; which are currently in need of disruptive solutions such as Blockchain; and find niche market; seeking trust in society and government institutions and create value synergies for both in a friendlier world. State of the market for Cryptocurrency We could talk about euphoria if we had joined the cryptocurrency market a few years ago; with an investment of one hundred euros invested in Bitcoin; at that time. Today we would have in our portfolio more than five million euros. On the contrary; those who did so in the end of 2017 are in a panic situation with significant losses after the market has made a major adjustment. The current moment is good. Now the market is developed and demanded; projects that are behind the crypto models bring significant value to society; investors have a lot of information available on each project and we must ensure that projects are real and not speculative. But be careful; in this sector there is a lot of intruder taking advantage of the little knowledge that the investors have in search of the high economic returns that there were in previous years; existing a high percentage of fraud. Is simple to join to world of cryptocurrencies; it only takes a few clicks and does not require great knowledge of economics; but the rationality and pragmatism. Many people have found in this sector a way to make small monthly contributions; with micro-investments in the medium and long term; but not investing; or putting at risk more than what we are willing to lose at a given time and above all that is does not gravely affect our economy.

Graphene prosthetics and the cyberpunk future,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write Graphene prosthetics and the cyberpunk future Don Basile · Follow 3 min read · Jan 3; 2019 -- Within science fiction; particularly the subgenre known as cyberpunk; humans augment themselves with various technological devices and prosthetics to enhance themselves beyond human capabilities; or to repair themselves in ways that perfectly replicate body functions. So how do modern prosthetics fare compared to the technological marvels of fiction? While we have made huge leaps forward in bionics and myoelectrics; we are not quite yet at the level of the cyberpunk future. But with graphene; we may just be able to get there. The material’s strength; light weight; and endless utility could lead to even more dramatic advancements in prosthetic technology. In modern prosthetics; bionic limbs have done excellently in replicating movement and function of missing body parts for amputees; offering mostly full range of motion for legs; feet; arms; and hands. This can be contributed to the development of myoelectric sensors; which connect the artificial limb to the natural electrical processes generated by muscles in order to enable complex movement. Hand prosthetics in particular have made major advancements in replicating the intricate and specific motor functions of fingers. Our advancements in prosthetics make it so that we can successfully regain lost function; but still lack meaningful tactile perception. While some might argue that the absence of pain is a benefit; the use of touch to perceive potentially harmful stimuli to the host would be a valuable addition to the features prosthetics provide; not to mention the emotional and psychological relief that may come with such upgrades to prosthetic tech. This is where graphene can step in. Scientists have begun to use the wonder material to create a graphene-based skin for prosthetics. This e-dermis electrically stimulates the amputee’s nerves non-invasively through the skin; replicating the process of signal relaying that the brain utilizes in tactile feeling. In addition; graphene’s optical transparency allows for 98% of light to pass through it; making the perfect material to utilize solar energy to power these advanced prosthetics. Of course; pain is not the only feeling that this graphene skin would allow users to process; and it’s potential to make the feeling from phantom limbs a reality again is truly wondrous to behold. Even more intricate; graphene can potentially be used to create small implants and internal prostheses that would be capable of correcting eyesight or hearing; to repair the body and help in overcoming degenerative diseases; or even help mend broken bones. Previously; silicon-based implants were too damaging to internal tissues if disturbed; and the conditions inside the body damaged the electronic components. However; graphene’s strength; being 200 times stronger than steel; and its flexibility make it much more durable. It is also possible to use graphene to create transistors that are gated by the natural fluids surrounding the implant. With graphene; the hyper-advanced technological developments of cyberpunk are closer than ever. With graphene; prosthetics are on the cusp of reaching the technological heights of science fiction. Like with many graphene-based products; they are mostly in the testing and research phase; but it’s clear that the application of graphene can bring about a new era in the field of prosthetics and change countless lives.

Enterprise Application Development- Expectations; Reality; and Challenges,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write Enterprise Application Development- Expectations; Reality; and Challenges Maegan Cook · Follow 3 min read · Jan 2; 2019 Enterprise applications have become an indispensable part of the modern business. From facilitating the customers to promoting business; a customized enterprise mobile app can perform a wide range of operations. The app can thereby promote the growth of the company by increasing the sales figure. As Techopedia mentions; An Enterprise Application or EA is a specially designed software system that operates in a corporate environment. The corporate can be anything like a local or state Government body; a business of any size; non-profit groups; etc. The enterprise application development company can make a customized app with characteristics like scalability; robustness; business-orientation; communication and managerial abilities. All these aspects give enterprise apps an edge over normal apps. Let’s dig deep into the enterprise app development process to explore what it can do and the hurdles are there in the way of making an app that can address the requirements of employees and customers alike. We will go through the process from the perspective of the user’s expectations. How do we want the Enterprise app development process to be? Well; a reliable mobile application development company can take up the projects of developing enterprise software. The reason is simple: Only such a company has necessary expertise and experience to build customized enterprise software. Both these aspects are necessary because the enterprise mobile app development involves a complex process that includes the following features. Focus on users — Just like traditional apps; the enterprise app also focuses on the end users. The user-centric enterprise app should give a pleasant experience; and capable of adding more and more users. In a way; the enterprise app should act as a bridge between clients and the employees. Only such an app can ultimately meet its goals. Security — It is obvious that an enterprise app deals in loads of data on a daily basis. The data can be segregated in the customer’s data and corporate data. In both types; the data safety plays a critical role. The security aspect is also necessary for the app that facilitates online transactions. As the incidences of security breaches are increasing worldwide; it is necessary to have An app with the highest level of security. Integration — Enterprises use various devices and software for simplifying and automating their processes. An enterprise mobile app can be seamlessly integrated with all these devices. Also; it should be an integral part of the existing business system while connecting with the existing resources. Speed — 5G technology is all set to come in our lives. It will bring the days of high speed of network and apps. There; an enterprise app should be compatible with the current and upcoming technology trends. Also; the ever-increasing pile of data should also be taken care of by mobile app developers. Well; these are a few of expectations from a feature-rich enterprise app. It is interesting to see how it works in reality; at least to date.

Brandon Simons and the origins of crypto,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write Brandon Simons and the origins of crypto LendoChain · Follow 2 min read · Jan 2; 2019 Brandon Simons; technical director at Verge (XVG) has “released a tell-all account about the origin of the cryptocurrency and his involvement with the early development and marketing efforts;” according to CCN. Simons; who is known as CryptoRekt on social media; revealed that his interest in cryptocurrency “first began in October 2009 when he discovered bitcoin;” and that he mined it for the next two years. In his Medium post he also discusses the fact that he experienced a hard disk crash in 2011; when he lost thousands of bitcoin and that afterwards he became a regular contributor to Reddit’s r/Cryptocurrency forum. This was a support group for people who had gone through a similar experience. CCN reports: “The loss he said; was where the nickname ‘CryptoRekt’ came from. It was in the course of this that he became involved with a privacy coin project known as DogeCoinDark (DOGED); which would later rebrand as Verge (XVG).” Simons recounts how DOGED started with a small team of 120 users in an Internet Relay Chat (IRC) room; and that it grew its vision of “enabling private peer-to-peer transactions; eventually rebranding itself as Verge in an attempt to gain more widespread appeal.” The marketing efforts included ‘shilling’ on social media and getting mentions on radio Crypto; which was at the time one of the most important media outlets for crypto stories. Verge remained relatively obscure within the crypto space until the release of the project’s whitepaper tagged ‘BlackPaper’ in June 2017. Simons followed this with putting together a global team to support Verge on a pro-bono basis; and according to Simons this Verge Core Marketing team has around 40 members. Explaining the importance Verge has to him on a personal level Simons said: Verge is truly something special; it is decentralized; it has a wonderful community around the world; and it has a team of passionate individuals who just want to see it succeed — all the required ingredients for a successful project. What does Verge mean to me? Freedom. Verge to me is the freedom to help create & shape something that can truly provide a means for people to be able to retain a bit of their personal lives and not have to worry about sacrificing a basic human right; privacy; any time they want to transact for goods & services.

5 Biggest Challenges of IoT,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write 5 Biggest Challenges of IoT eForte.net · Follow 6 min read · Jan 2; 2019 -- By the year 2020; the market size for the Internet of Things (IoT for short) will reach an approximate €242;222 million. Although relatively new; the field of IoT has risen dramatically during the years. But everything has its risks and security concerns especially when it comes to the field of technology. Since IoT has not yet penetrated the mainstream market; there is intense competition among the manufacturers on getting their products and devices to the consumers first. This often results in overlooking the potential security issues that can arise regarding data access and management as well as the IoT devices themselves. Below is a list of some major security concerns associated with IoT Insufficient testing and updating: As of 2018; it has been estimated that the number of IoT devices connected in connected and smart homes is 17 billion and will rise up to 20 billion by 2020. This influx of latest gadgets and devices also means that tech companies aren’t putting as much thought into the device security risks as they should have. Often many of these devices and IoT products do not get enough updates. Some of them don’t even have any updates. This results in devices that were once considered secure as the time of purchase by the customers often become less protected and may even become vulnerable to hackers and other security issues. The early computer systems suffered from this very problem. The lack of updates caused them to become prone to security risks where initially they weren’t. These issues were resolved with the automatic updates. Unfortunately; IoT manufacturers are more focused on launching and delivering their products as fast as they can; giving little thought to security. Even if manufacturers do release their firmware updates; they tend to do so only for a brief period of time which lasts the moment they start working on their next big gadget. And to make matters worse; they use unsupported legacy Linux kernels. Source: Google Images Ultimately all this results in their customers being prone to potential security attacks because of outdated hardware and software both. In order to fully secure yourself from such attacks; the manufacturers need to implement a proper testing and quality assurance system before launching their devices to the public. Furthermore; companies should remain careful in updating them regularly. The importance of updates should never be underestimated the entire reputation of the company can be at stake. It only requires one single large scale breach of data to make the customers lose their faith in the company and bring down its image. IoT malware and ransomware: Because of the expected rise in IoT devices; it is not unfair to expect the rise of IoT malwares and ransomwares too. The traditional malwares were reliant on encryption to completely lock the users out from their devices. Now with the advent of hybridization of malwares and ransomwares; their attacks can be a lot more varied now with potentially devastating effects. For instance; a simple Internet Protocol (IP) camera can be easily accessed to capture confidential information using several locations like your home or your office. The webcam can then be locked from its user while all its data is transferred to a web address designed to browse and extract sensitive data by using the malware’s access point. Once this has been done; ransom is then demanded from the original user for unlocking the device and returning the data. While this is a textbook example of malwares and ransomwares; the rapidly growing field of IoT also enables an entire field of attacks on these devices. Source: Google Images IoT Botnets and cryptocurrency: Unless if you have been living under a rock; you would probably be aware of cryptocurrency; even if not in too much detail. The intense mining competition and the rise in cryptocurrency is a highly tempting opportunity for hackers. Although blockchain technology was designed to prevent hacking and modification of data; there is still a steady increase in the number of attacks in several blockchain sectors. The targeted area isn’t the blockchain itself; it’s the app development which is running blockchain. There are several methods already underway to extract sensitive information; one of which is social engineering. Through this method; confidential information like usernames; passwords; private keys are being hacked. Cryptocurrencies are also being mined with IoT devices. Monero is an example of the many open source cryptocurrency that can be mined from these devices. There have been several cases of hackers having repurposed IP and video cameras for mining cryptocurrencies. IoT devices and applications need to be constantly updated and regulated if we are to counter the threat of these exploitation methods. The field of cryptocurrency is already quite unpredictable and data manipulation can result in flooding the crypto-market and cause havoc. Brute forcing and default passwords: One of the most prominent cases of brute forcing was the Mirai malware which was used in some of the largest DDoS attacks to the devices that were shipped with default passwords. The customers were not instructed to change the default usernames and passwords when they were received. While there are indeed some governmental reports that advise companies against selling IoT devices with default usernames and passwords like “admin”; these reports are simply considered mere guidelines for which there isn’t any legal action. Nor are there any incentives for companies to forgo this practice. These weak credentials make all the IoT devices prone to password hacking; especially the brute force method. Source: Google Images Privacy and security: Today’s world of inter-connectivity with practically everyone has both facilitated the communication process and has also created a whole range of security threats. Data is in a constant flux of being stored and processed every second by companies and businesses of every type on multiple platforms including IoT devices like smart TVs; HVAC systems; smart thermostats; connected printers; speakers and lighting systems and many more. Unfortunately it is a fact that most of our data is shared or sold between companies which is quite clearly a breach of privacy and is a criminal act. Not only does it allow unauthorized access to our personal info but it also destroys a company’s image and the trust it had built with its customers. To ensure that sensitive information is not being distributed; there should be a stricter implementation of the privacy policies. Another way is to redact and anonymize sensitive data prior to storing it on IoT devices which may be used to identify the individual owning them. Similar practices can be applied for mobile applications; services and other electronic devices which store and utilize data in some form or another. It is recommended for a company that handles sensitive information to go through a directory of mobile and web application development companies that can help you in ensuring data security and can prevent breaches and attacks. These cyber security companies; provided that you opt for a good; reliable one; can go a long way to protect your data. Although IoT devices have yet to reach their full penetration of the mass market; their development is making progress by leaps and bounds. It won’t be long that IoT becomes a household term just like today’s smartphones are. If you would like to read more; visit https://eforte.net/blog/.

“Flat Organization just works” — How Punchkick’s method helps it flourish,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write “Flat Organization just works” — How Punchkick’s method helps it flourish Scott Kitun · Follow 4 min read · Jan 2; 2019 -- “It’s crazy. It just works;” says Zak Dabbas of the “flat” organizational structure behind his digital marketing agency; Punchkick Interactive. “Flat just means that everybody has the same opportunity to grow.” For Zak; flat isn’t just a buzzword. It’s a reflection of his personal journey. Zak was pre-med in college; intending to follow in his father’s footsteps and become a physician. But life had other plans. Zak Dabbas; CEO and co-founder of Punchkick Interactive (John Rosin/Technori) “My last year; I got testicular cancer. I went through chemo; all of it;” he says. It was a nightmare. I had this moment where I was like; I don’t want to be in hospitals for the rest of my life. That’s not my passion.” So Zak did what he thought was the next best thing: law school. While getting his JD; Zak and his now-business-partner began building digital projects on the side; for “weekend money;” he says. Soon; he realized that his side hustle was what really lit him up. “I thought; this is the only thing I like;” Zak says. “The only thing I’m excited about is the digital work we do.” “So in the middle of law school; we got a website up; got some spec projects on it; and I started firing off new business emails. By the time I graduated; we had landed two Fortune-level clients. I walked into the law firm where I was working at the time and said; ‘smell you later. I’m outta here.’ And I never looked back.” Zak’s roundabout path to creative agency CEO has given him a unique perspective on leadership. “Because I had been beaten and battered by all these other industries I was in previously — especially in law — when I started Punchkick; I wanted it to be a safe place;” he says. “The philosophy behind it was always flat. I hired people that I really liked; respected; and admired; who I would want to work with. Because; I have one life to live. I’m going to enjoy this.” Zak sees the culture of Punchkick as its key differentiator in the vast digital marketing landscape. The team of about 40 is run without managers or other traditional hierarchical roles. New employees choose their own title; based on their skill set and experience. Company financials and client health project statuses are completely transparent. Daily morning huddles create a close-knit atmosphere. An agile workflow keeps things humming along. “This company has grown to become almost like a group of mini-CEOs;” Zak says. “It’s unbelievable — the initiatives that happen internally and organically. What our clients hopefully find is that the team is so dedicated and intelligent. It’s really nice to have a company where everybody can deliver so much value.” Zak credits Frederic Laloux’s groundbreaking book “Reinventing Organizations;” which applies concepts of mindfulness and human evolution to model a more “soulful” workplace. “It’s the only book I’ll ever plug;” says Zak. “I don’t really ever read business books; but it’s great.” Flat organization isn’t the only thing that sets Punchkick apart. The agency stands out with a user-oriented approach. “The processes we have are really solid. We’ve been around. We know what we’re doing. But we’re not trusting of ourselves. We trust the audience. So we don’t build projects or products without actually doing user research and testing; and really hearing that it’s a winning product.” To date; Punchkick’s clients include Harley-Davidson; Walmart; Microsoft; Allstate; and Intuit. One of Zak’s favorite projects is their design and development of Marriott’s flagship e-commerce app. Making humongous clients like Marriott ecstatic takes top-notch talent; Zak says. Clearly he’s able to attract it because of the culture he’s created at Punchkick. I have conversations with companies looking for tech talent all day; every day. Take note: if you don’t follow Zak’s lead and foster an environment where people get to work together as a unit; you’re going to have a very hard time hiring and keeping the best people. Siloing is not just a culture issue; it’s boxing yourself in. Zak agrees: “the quality of work suffers;” he says. How does Punchkick keep everyone accountable without management? Transparency. “I don’t hide anything;” Zak says. “And I feel like it just results in people I can really trust. Because there’s so much transparency; people don’t want to let down their peers.” Originally published at technori.com on January 2; 2019.

The death of the internet as we know it?,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write The death of the internet as we know it? Eko Adetolani · Follow 2 min read · Jan 2; 2019 22 The internet as we know it might change in 2019 and here is why: The internet is going to be more difficult and boring to use starting in 2019 because of the strict "Article 13" regulations currently being considered by the EU. Article 11 and Article 13 which have gained the nicknames “link tax” and “meme ban” respectively. Together they make up the European Union Directive on Copyright in the Digital Single Market. This has been primarily created to limit how copyrighted content is shared online. Article 13 basically just states that internet companies like Facebook; Instagram; YouTube; Twitter; LinkedIn e.t.c will be sanctioned when a user posts copyrighted material on their platform. Because of the fear of sanctions; everything you post on the internet will go through heavy scrutiny and will most likely be disallowed. This means no more memes; playing songs in the background of your videos; posting educational or funny videos you found on the internet e.t.c Previously it was the job of the content owner (record labels; directors; photographers e.t.c) to find and report use of their material but now it has become the job of the platform owner (Instagram; Twitter; LinkedIn e.t.c) to prevent it. How does this affect people outside the EU? Well most social networks just adhere to the strictest rules available and implement it across all their systems regardless of the geographic location. After the implementation of GDPR regulations I’m sure you got notifications of updated privacy policies on all major platforms you use even though you don’t live in a country under the EU…. Well that’s how it works. Could this be the death of the internet as we know it?

2019: The Year of Education,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write 2019: The Year of Education The digital revolution is at a tipping point. It’s time to rethink why; what; and how we teach. Joe Brooks · Follow Published in Community Works Journal: Digital Magazine for Educators · 7 min read · Jan 2; 2019 By ERIK P.M. VERMEULIN Reinventing education is a challenging but urgent task. We are witnessing an exponential growth of technology. Artificial intelligence; sensors; data-analytics; and blockchain (to name a few) are amplifying and accelerating each other. This will lead to new applications across all areas of the economy and society in 2019. In a digital age; any new approach to education needs to adopt a more “skills-based” focus that aims to build creativity. After all; we (and in particular the next generation) must be prepared to live and work more closely with intelligent; networked machines. The main focus of education shouldn’t be on the transfer of knowledge of standardized processes and procedures (these will certainly be automated) but on cultivating innovative and creative skills that cannot easily be replicated by machines. In a world of smart technologies; a premium will be put on the most human of qualities; our capacity for unique and highly personalized forms of self-expression. And all education needs to be re-organized around this goal. I have written about this issue before; but I want to make it more concrete for 2019. Think about it as my New Year’s resolution. We need to get more serious about teaching the skills relevant for a digital age. I’ve already made significant changes to my courses; focusing more on developing student creativity. But next year; I want to go even further by introducing three “new” components: (1) “multidisciplinary collaboration;” (2) “visionary thinking;” and (3) “EdTech.” #Multidisciplinary Collaboration The Industrial Revolution of the 19th century was the starting point for the process-oriented and proceduralized society we know today. Standardized product development; manufacturing and supply chain processes created efficiencies and led to economic growth and social welfare. Specialization became important. Of course; people still had to work in teams; but each discipline had its responsibilities; and team members relied on each other to bring a unique expertise to the table. Teamwork and collaboration are also crucial to the development of digital technologies and their applications. However; the transition from products to services and the shift in business models from “pipes” (where products are being continually pushed out to consumers) to “platforms” (where stakeholders are creating services/value together) entails that co-creation has become much more important. This means that “multidisciplinary teams” work more closely together. This means that everyone needs to operate beyond their specialty. This has had an enormous impact on team dynamics. Team members need a different skillset in the so-called platform economy. To co-create; it is vital that the members speak each other’s’ language; or at least understand one another. A more open and curious mindset has become a pre-requisite to the success of all teams. Multidisciplinary collaboration must be taught. It needs to become a mandatory part of every curriculum at any level or age. Of course; we still need specialists; but more than ever they have to be open-minded; be able to listen and master the skills to collaborate and communicate effectively. #Visionary Thinking There are plenty of examples of technological disruption. But after watching this Coldfusion video on YouTube; it became clear that companies are not being disrupted by the technologies themselves. Instead; they suffer from a lack of “vision.” When confronted with new technological developments/new technologies (even when they are offered to them); CEOs and other executives point to a long list of inefficiencies concerning the usability; reliability; and adaptability of the new technologies. The telephone was just a “toy.” Television was “boring” (compared to the cinema experience). The energy use of computers was off the charts; preventing it from becoming a mainstream product. Modern smartphones didn’t have a “real keyboard” (and were thus not suitable for business people). In each case; the executives didn’t see the potential of new technologies to disrupt established markets and to become commercially attractive. In each case; there was a failure of vision. Of course; it is too simple to say that we need more visionaries. History shows that these visionaries (who were in the Apple Think Different campaign more than twenty years ago referred to as “the rebels; the troublemakers; the crazy ones; or the geniuses”) are hard to find. This doesn’t mean that we should not pay more attention to the creation of new and fresh perspectives in our educational programs. Again; we are at a tipping point. Technological disruption has become “normalized” and a routine part of everyday work and life. The consequences of the technological revolution go much further than the disruption of a company. Ignoring the speed and magnitude of the disruptive potential of digital technologies could be “catastrophic.” It is; therefore; necessary to teach students the capacity to develop constantly a fresh and new perspective and to revisit the wisdom of the often long-held assumptions; theories; and business models. That is not to say that these models are always wrong; but the capacity for critical thinking helps the students to maintain an open and fresh view of the world. With the developments in artificial intelligence and decentralized technologies (such as blockchain); maintaining a fresh perspective has become a must-have skill. We need more diversity rather than people that know how to follow and execute processes and procedures. The re-education of Economics 101 On a dreary Wednesday lunchtime in October; more than 300 students are packed into one of University College London’s… qz.com #EdTech EdTech (or education technology) has a broad definition. It includes everything from the straightforward use of computers to entire online teaching platforms; mobile learning applications; gamification and augmented and virtual reality solutions. In short; it aims to use digital technologies to disrupt education. EdTech companies have been around for about a decade now. Companies in this area started to attract attention from angels; venture capitalists and other risk capital investors in 2010. Looking at the investment data; it appears that there is already a decline in interest in EdTech. Investments in EdTech. Source: Crunchbase Yet; EdTech companies can be expected to generate more attention in 2019. But when I discuss developments in EdTech with my colleagues; it appears that they are still far from up to speed with the latest technologies. The EdTech industry is currently dominated by technologists without the necessary educational experience. But I expect that educators will become more involved next year. For sure; their attitude towards EdTech need to change. It creates significant opportunities to deliver the combination of technological; collaborative and vision-based skills that are necessary in a digital age. What is more important is that EdTech solutions are necessary to develop a learning architecture that helps kickstart the critical cycle of self-learning. And mastering the cycle of self-learning is essential to enable students to learn continually; study and adapt to the new technological developments. So; What About “How”? I am currently working on setting up partnerships with “EdTech” companies that integrate “EdTech” solutions and strategies in my program/courses. Multidisciplinary collaborations will be stimulated by organizing “hackathons” and other assignments. Teaching “visionary thinking” will be more challenging. One thing is certain. To “produce” thinkers; I need to behave less like a traditional teacher pushing out knowledge to students. I will act more as an influencer and co-creator inspiring students to think and challenge traditional assumptions and models. Grades will largely depend on the way the fresh and new perspectives are explained and supported. I very much look forward to the in-class experience in 2019.

Are Our Educators Prepared For Their Students?,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write Are Our Educators Prepared For Their Students? Joe Brooks · Follow Published in Community Works Journal: Digital Magazine for Educators · 7 min read · Jan 3; 2019 -- By TOM WHITBY If there is one thing that I am sure of as an educator it is that rapid change greatly affects both what and how we learn. If there is a second thing that I am sure of as an educator it is that the evolution of technology is the driver of rapid change throughout our culture. Both of these factors in education and our culture lead me to question if teachers are being properly prepared to teach students whose learning is affected by so many different influences? The past learning experiences of educators are so different from the current and evolving experiences of their students that relevance as an educator is extremely important. Do today’s teachers understand the learning needs of today’s students? A generational gap is a world of difference in terms of technology. For this reason I feel that many educators are products of a 20th century education that limits them as educators in the 21st century. Of course there are educators who have continually; professionally developed to stay relevant; but maybe not in enough numbers to make a great difference. In the 20th century information was for the most part slower to change and often controlled by a small group of power brokers. News came from newspapers and magazines that were limited to publishing cycles and editors. The media was dominated by three networks which were limited by news cycles and strict editorial boards. Censors were assigned to every entertainment show to regulate the perceived moral agenda. Encyclopedias took years to amend and edit with an additional year to physically publish and were limited in circulation by high costs to the general public. Most households had telephones; but not a private line for each household member. The challenges of rapid change were not yet in place even though the stage was being set. The Vietnam War began to awaken changes in the way we viewed the news. Journalists used more media tools in their reporting. Photos and film began to be broadcast in the news cycle; which was at a family-gathered dinnertime for most Americans. Students were moved by what they saw and many began to demonstrate against the government in numbers never before seen. These demonstrations then became media news as well; which exacerbated the anti-war movement. It took years of this to bring the war to an end; even with the help of the existing technology; which was controlled by forces heavily influenced by the government. This was the way it was until the introduction of cable for more choice in entertainment and 24 hour news reporting. Gaming came along with Pong and later Donkey Kong; followed by The Oregon Trail. Calculators became portable and electronic. Life was good and teaching was pretty much focused on lecture and direct instruction because that was how it was always done. It worked because that was all we knew. The teacher stood in the front and students sat in rows. The Internet was about to take a wrecking ball to that whole mindset prevalent in that century in that world. Now we arrive in the 21st century with all of its technological advances. The Internet provides access to most of information ever to be established in the world. It provides access to entertainment that is often uncensored and unfiltered. Smartphones; which are not really phones; but powerful computers with phone capabilities. People have 24-hour connectivity to any person or source for the purpose of collaboration; curation; or simple communication. Computer-generated games that are realistic and intelligent; that may be played collaboratively and simultaneously with people around the world. What does all of this have to do with our students today is the question that we need to address. Students today have grown up after all of these changes have taken place. Their world is different than many of their educators. It is also continuing to evolve even at a faster pace than ever before experienced and it will continue that way into the future. Today’s students have grown up immersed in technology. They have had access to computers their entire lives. Their smartphones have more power than the computers that were used to put a man on the moon. Students are entertained by shows that they can select from literally hundreds of choices; most uncensored. Their news exposure is 24 hours a day from many sources. They can follow blogs that speak to their interests. They have mastered social media. They are comfortable collaborating with others. They are comfortable creating their own information in the form of text; music; audio; or video. The most important part of this is that their computer is their publisher. They need no adult permission to publish whatever they want to a waiting world on the Internet. They accept failure in games as a challenge to overcome in order to win. They can access any information at anytime to question any facts adults may throw at them. The most important point here is that they can also learn in spite of an irrelevant educator. Information once controlled by academia is now free and easily accessed. Educators should view these technology skills as assets to be supported and enhanced. Critical thinking should be a key to accessing the valid and valued information needed. Collaborative learning should be the focus before lecture and direct instruction. Students who have great choices in their everyday lives should have more of a say in their own learning. Student voice is essential for students to own their learning. Mentoring students in using their technology skills to curate; communicate; and create content is a more effective way to learn than to simply consume teacher-selected content. Educators need to understand that they are teaching kids to live in a world that is not yet here. We are not slow to change any longer. Developing students who are flexible and willing to continually learn is the best we can do to insure their future. Teaching kids how to learn is more important than to teach them what to learn. They will find on their own what it is that they personally need to learn. Preparation for that point in time is what we need to teach them. As I watch these students from Parkland; Florida; I am more convinced that this is the way we must teach. These kids are not “Actors” as some suggest. They are articulate; intelligent; technology savvy students who have a need to learn; create; collaborate; and communicate. They do it so well; it causes 20th century thinkers to question their validity. They are real; and now have a cause and a purpose with the skills to present it to their country. I am not saying that all teachers are not doing their best to teach. I believe that most are doing their very best. I also believe that in a world where change is so rapid; the tools that educators have been prepared with may no longer serve that purpose. We need to continually train educators more than one or two days in a year. Irrelevant teachers are the fault of the districts in which they work. If we are to better educate our kids; we must first better educate their educators.

11 ways social media will evolve in the future.,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write 11 ways social media will evolve in the future. Daniel Bernard · Follow 4 min read · Jan 2; 2019 -- Social media is growing at a rapid rate. As more and more people find new ways to contribute to social media; it will continue to unfold. Social media is an open platform and highly integrable with any other program or algorithms which allows for even more expansion and flexibility to make it even better. With these above ideas in mind; let us explore how social media will change as we progress. 1. Customized platform: With the integration of A.I. into social media; your profile and your social media will get customized according to your habits; behaviors; and personal preferences. You will be able to book cabs; order food and check your feed all in one platform. To be more succinct; social media will be an all-in-one app or platform for your daily needs and tasks. 2. Richness in quality of posts: The quality of social media posts will be rich in content and variety. As of now; you can see high-quality photos on Instagram. This will transcend all platforms. On top of that; the new IGTV feature in Instagram is gaining a ton of traction which will eventually convert to a mini YouTube sort of thing (already happening). These examples suggest a pattern or hint towards what we can expect in the future. 3. Videos: The Internet is more accessible now than ever. Facebook recently announced that it would focus more on delivering videos to your news feed and suggested that videos were the future in social media. If you are a frequent user of Facebook; you may have already noticed this trend. Facebook is going to add more videos to your newsfeed. 4. Customizable: Social media platforms will adhere to your preferences; tastes; and needs. This means that you will be able to select the themes and layout; customize the tabs; and design the layout you want from a selection of combinations. 5. Mobile-friendly: If you head over to the Instagram website on your PC and login; you will notice that it doesn’t allow for messages and has limited features. Instagram is totally mobile-based and this is what the social media giants and new social media platforms will come up with in the future. They will focus entirely on mobile. 6. Experimental: Social media will undergo a ton of experiments. These experiments will make the user experience much better. These may include the use of Virtual reality; 3D images or videos; Artificial Intelligence etc. 7. Integration: Since social media already has a lot of data (contacts; numbers; people information etc.); it is effortless to add a payment app or integrate with payment gateway or other similar features making social media friendlier and easier to use. However; privacy is a concern which brings us to the next point. 8. Privacy: Social media companies are taking privacy more seriously now more than over. Since; they have accumulated a lot of contact details; personal details etc. they bear a public responsibility to protect and secure the data. Data in the wrong hands can be misused and the consequences can be severe. 9. Sharing of data: This point is subtle but powerful. With the help of your social media usage; companies gather small data over time; and these will help other companies like e-commerce or any ad companies to understand your likes; preferences and spending habits. This will allow the companies to advertise the product you want and make sure that you see it. This will result in effective advertising. This is highly beneficial to companies. You may argue that this is already in process; however; it is also worthy to note that this feature will enhance and get more accurate. 10. Community building: To an extent; small communities will stop building websites and instead use social media as their main source of communication both internally and externally. With bots; communities will be able to get in touch and answer customers’ queries easily and effortlessly. This will encourage more communities in the long-run. 11. More Real: Though we are coming across thousands of photo-shopped Instagram images; we are also learning that expressing authenticity is equally important. This awareness has already been initiated and slowly getting popular. On a broader perspective; these are the 11 ways social media will evolve and make our lives and business better. If you have any more points; do let us know. Thanks for reading. Sign up to discover human stories that deepen your understanding of the world. Free Distraction-free reading. No ads.

How Technology is making the planet Greener.,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write How Technology is making the planet Greener. KISHORE K J · Follow Published in GREENKRAFTZ.ORG · 2 min read · Jan 2; 2019 We all perceive technology is the root cause of global warming; pollution and what not . Not all technology are in mission to destroy the earth. Let’s see how internet and computers are saving the planet . Personal Computers — Imagine an office without a computer ; stacks of files ; pens ; papers ; shredders ; dustbins . Where do papers come from . ? From Trees of-course ; What about the amount of fuel and energy spent on its harvest .? What about the transportation of raw wood ; the industry that process it ; Chemical waste generated in such process; Solid waste thats leftover ; finally the packing and transportation for these to reach your hands or the office . All type of pollution is covered in this process like Air ; Water ; Noise ; Land Pollution and not to mention the amount of deforestation. And don’t forget the Pencils we use write on them ; that’s the whole story once more. And Disposal of these wastes are again gonna have their effects. E-Mail — Emails may be a quick and easy way of communications ; but its one the best planet saver ; Just think about the number of mails the postal network use to process . Again the papers and waste generated . The Pollution caused by transportation of these physical mails. Instant Messaging — Many Official bodies still prefer use of physical mails over E-mails but no individual prefers to send a Physical mail thanks to our trust on our postal system that only one in every ten mail we send will reach the destination that to with in the same year; isn’t that a great achievement .But very unlikely people are not kind hearted to appreciate such effort and rather choose to move on to much cheaper and reliable ways to communicate; through calls ;sms and instant messaging . This actually saves papers by the billions ; assuming we are one of the most populous countries. And also save in huge amounts on transportation based pollution. Shopping — We had to step into a hundred shops before we were satisfied to make a purchase ; now it’s just 10 clicks away. Well technology has made it simple and efficient ; no physical shops ; then no waste of electricity ; maintenance. Goods can be stored and retrieved in compact spaces . This save a 100 trips to and from shops by a hundred people to just one round trip by a delivery van in the evening. Computer and Internet are not only making us lazy (reduces CO2 ) ; but they also tend to save the planet in a few other ways. Let’s seek a greener future with technology.

Name it; Friendster beaten up by Facebook. Path which very well known in Indonesia; only survive last then 2 years. Instagram so far the most popular social media in 2016–2018; but let see in couple years ahead. Facebook is now declining due to issue of privacy and stereotype for older person. People is so easy to get bored On the other hand; with the ease of software development; so (too) many solutions arise. Most of millennial are very creative; they create e-solution for almost everything. Do you want to save money? Go to bank; mobile banking; online investment; trading online. Do you need transportation? Book online; traveloka; pegipegi; tiket.com; etc. Do you hungry? Go to “warung”; go-food; grab-food; call delivery service Want to save photo? Go to google photos; instagram; facebook; NAS How about boring? Get netflix; buy voucher traveloka; open youtube So many alternatives to ease you; but its getting complex on the other hand. It was easy to define how much money do you have? Sum up your bank account; gold and house. Now? Don’t forget your mutual fund account in asset management X; Y; Z. Sum up also your bitcoin account; that might be fluctuated like roller coaster. Hmm..also you still have credit in GoPay. It seems you still have deposit also in OVO and Dana. How about credit in M-Tix; that’s part of your wealth also. And you can list down; as much as you can (remember). It’s good to have a broaden knowledge about new technology/solutions arise. But keep your life simple! So many solutions that alike one another. If you take it all; you’ll ended up with too complex life. Review new solutions arise; if it’s better then migrate; don’t duplicate. Here’re my own list for some function of life: * file storage for personal: use google drive * file storage for business: onedrive plus sharepoint (soon) * bank: use 1 main account; and 1 more account for saving. Other bank? has been closed! * investment: don’t put your egg in one basket still applicable. So differentiate the risks; but simplify the variety. Buy some golds; mutual funds; stocks; properties.

The 6 Most Common Cyber Security Mistakes Your Employees Are Making,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write The 6 Most Common Cyber Security Mistakes Your Employees Are Making Lazarus_Alliance · Follow 3 min read · Jan 2; 2019 With an estimated 90% of cyber attacks caused by human error or behavior; it’s important to understand the most common cyber security mistakes your employees are probably making and know how to mitigate them. Becoming victims of phishing schemes Stolen login credentials are the most common way hackers breach enterprise systems; and most of the time; these credentials are stolen through a phishing scheme. A highly targeted variant of phishing; called spear phishing or business email compromise; is used to convince employees to wire money or send sensitive data; such as W2 information; to cyber criminals. Avoid having your employees make this cyber security mistake by educating them about the warning signs of a phishing scheme. Organizations must also establish policies against sending sensitive data through email; ensure that employees have access only to the systems and data they need to do their jobs; and add redundancy into payment approval processes; especially wire transfers. Mistakes involving login credentials This is a broad category of cyber security mistakes that includes: Using weak passwords Not using multi-factor authentication whenever possible Reusing passwords Sharing login credentials Writing credentials down and leaving them in public areas; such as sticky notes in the work area Leaving a terminal unattended without logging out first Most of these security mistakes can be avoided through employee education on the dangers of not keeping login credentials secure. Organizations can also employ technical measures to force login sessions to automatically time out when a terminal is inactive; require the use of MFA; and automatically generate strong passwords. Using shadow IT software and services Over three-quarters of employees admit to using shadow IT software and services at the workplace. Most of the time; their intentions are not malicious. They are simply trying to do their jobs better; and they do not realize how dangerous shadow IT can be to security and compliance. Employee education is the best way to head off this security mistake. Technical tools can also be employed to ferret out shadow IT apps. Inserting “mystery” devices into workplace computers A common social engineering tactic is for hackers to leave USB thumb drives and other plugin devices in public areas where employees will find them. Sometimes; the devices will have labels meant to entice employees to want to covertly access them; such as “Q4 Performance Reviews” or indicating that the device contains pornographic content. Employees must be educated about the dangers of making this security mistake. Making security mistakes when using public WiFi Free public WiFi networks are ubiquitous; found everywhere from fast-food restaurants to aboard trains. Remote workers and employees who frequently travel for business often take advantage of public WiFi to work on the go. As with shadow IT apps; this is usually because of a security mistake; not maliciousness or negligence; employees don’t realize how dangerous public WiFi is. In addition to educating employees on best practices when accessing public WiFi networks; organizations should provide VPN access to all employees who work remotely. Not protecting computers and other IoT devices This security mistake involves physical protection as well as password protection. In a recent survey; over half of working adults admitted to allowing friends and family to access devices given to them by their employers. Employees who travel for work may also leave devices unattended in public areas or hotel rooms or allow strangers to “borrow” their smart phones. Employees who travel need to be educated about best cyber practices when traveling. Organizations should ensure that these employees’ devices are protected with strong passwords; multi-factor authentication; or a biometric lock. If possible; have disposable phones and laptops on hand to loan to employees for travel purposes. If an employee must travel with a device that contains sensitive data; make sure the device is encrypted. Originally published at continuumgrc.com on January 2; 2019.

As professionals; if we continue to do what we have always done; we’ll miss out on opportunities to grow. At SmartBug Media; our team is full of knowledge hogs. Whether it’s the latest and greatest or someone else’s tried and true; we want to know everything there is to know about it. Despite being a 100 percent remote team; we participate in bi-weekly all-hands meetings via Zoom (our “Brady Bunch” images are awesome). During a recent gathering; each SmartBug team member answered this question: In addition to HubSpot (which is the foundation of our technology stack); what marketing tools have you discovered in the last year that have significantly helped you grow as an intelligent inbound professional? The recommendations were too good not to share with our community of subscribers. Paul Schmidt; Marketing Strategist Recommendation: Moz Keyword Explorer’s Competitor Functionality “This is my secret sauce to understanding the breadth of topics that competitors are owning in organic search. As part of any SEO-related campaign; I use this tool to see if there are other keywords that I should be targeting; as well as to understand the kinds of content that rank well for a given set of topics.” Nicki Kamau; Marketing Director Recommendation: Databox “When I want to report on a campaign’s effectiveness; HubSpot is my initial go-to; but sometimes I want to verify or expand on the data I’m seeing; and then I hop into Google Analytics. With Databox; I’m able to configure a dashboard for myself that aggregates the data I’m looking for from both platforms; automatically. Databox also delivers the dashboard to my inbox; saving me time.” Jennifer Lux; (now former) Marketing Strategist and Team Lead Recommendation: Spiceworks “This excellent resource for IT companies conducts and publishes market surveys frequently that quantify the evolving technology landscape. Spiceworks provides research to help optimize IT lead generation with meaningful market insights.” Drew Cohen; Marketing Strategist and Team Lead Recommendation: LocationScan by Yext “Many times; when it comes to local SEO; companies don’t know where to start. By having a nifty little tool that shows your directory and citation listings; LocationScan by Yext can really give you a great foundation to build off of.” Other team recommendations include the following: GaggleAMP for social media engagement and reach amplification SEMRush for competitive intelligence Lumen5 for AI-powered video creation Hotjar for website heatmaps and visitor recordings ReturnPath for email deliverability BrokenLinkCheck.com checks your website for broken links :-) Google Tag Manager for managing JavaScript and HTML tags used for tracking and analytics CoverageBook; a reporting tool to measure impact of public relations Email on Acid measures email across the most popular clients; apps; and devices Have you had great experiences with these marketing tools?

Paradigm Shift in Corporate Banking on Blockchain Adoption,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write Paradigm Shift in Corporate Banking on Blockchain Adoption Farhang Maghdeed · Follow 2 min read · Jan 2; 2019 -- Over the past thirty years; central banks focused on fighting inflation globally and have been failing. Given that inflation has been identified as the major culprit in most of the global depression since the 1920’s to today; no wonder most financial institutions have made it their target trying to control and manage it. However; it was the financial crisis of 2008 that led to deeper questioning of economic processes; credit system and debt management. The recession pointed out a gap in the public’ trust in financial institutions and governments due to the lack of transparency and accountability in financial world. The question on everyone’s mind is: will this stop; or it will continue? Are there any solutions out there that can prevent the collapse of financial fundamentals that are built around a centralised system? Not a question with an easy or short answer; but the smart money seems to be on blockchain architecture that is using cutting edge technology to build trust and transparency. Blockchain platform are attracting the attention of financial service sector to its innovative technology that is set to change the future and it has emerged as a new paradigm in the financial industry. In 2016; the World Economic Forum (WEF) predicted that blockchain will revolutionize financial services; and build a solid platform where consumers and producers / buyers and sellers will converge. The financial sector however; is apprehensive considering the technology’s link to cryptocurrencies and evolving blockchain technology use in other sectors. In 2017; the banking sector and remittance industry experienced industry disruptions and large-scale mergers. By the end of the year; a consensus between the banking sector and blockchain technologists were reached. In the first quarter of 2018 several banks started adopting and testing the technology in phases. Decentralised Ledger Technology (DLT) has created the “internet of value” by empowering peer to peer; transparent; immediate and almost free exchanges of value over the internet awakening the banking industry the real possibility of their demise and effectively killing the stranglehold they have on the financial markets; not a pretty thought if you are involved in the finance business. According to Statistics; from 2016 to 2021 it is estimated that blockchain technology is heating the global market aggressively; with the Blockchain industry market reacing 339.5 Million USD in size and is forecast to grow to 2.3 billion USD by 2021. Although banks and financial institutions have always been at the frontline of the technology evolution; it is very interesting to know they are preparing for a true battle. Who will win? Who will emerge triumphant and reap the spoils of war? It’s really too early to tell yet; but for Blockchain the future is bright.

10 Reasons Why Social Media Marketing is Indispensable for Your Business Today.,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write 10 Reasons Why Social Media Marketing is Indispensable for Your Business Today. Daniel Bernard · Follow 3 min read · Jan 2; 2019 -- Social Media is one of the most powerful tools in the marketing sector today. It has created a platform and foundation that will allow all types of companies to share their creative work and get recognized globally. Therefore; we have compiled 10 reasons to help you understand how social media can effectively grow your business and get you new customers. 1. Brand Awareness — When you post on Facebook about the brand; almost anyone in the world can view it and engage with your post. This opens the gateway to so many opportunities and prospective customers. 2. Increase in Sales — This is the most sought-after consequence for business owners after they make their brand presence known on social media. New prospective customers in and around the local area get to know about your brand and will choose to try out your brand. If it is e-commerce; then you will have a lot of requests for shipping from abroad or local areas. It will depend on your brand category or your industry. However; it will surely contribute to more sales. 3. Better Understanding of the marketplace — Once your brand gets recognized on social media; you will start to understand the marketplace better. You will get more awareness about your competitors; the current trends as well as the general overview of the demand and supply of the products/services. This will assist you in refining your product/service and empower you to sell better and create an overall pleasant experience. 4. New ideas — By interacting with customers online and getting valuable insights from data; you will be able to get new ideas for your current product/service or maybe even about a whole new different product. Ideas come from a variety of new experiences and that’s exactly what the social media promises. 5. Accountability — Social media gives you accurate data and if you are running ads; then you will be able to track more closely. By using this data; you can fine-tune your marketing strategies as well as proactively make changes to your customer support and service. 6. Customer Satisfaction — Companies have been able to respond to customer’s query better on Twitter; Instagram and Facebook. Social media allows for instant replies and decreases the response time between the customer and company. This will save time for both the company and the customer plus actions can easily be taken and this results in a good system for customer support which indeed adds to customer satisfaction. 7. Cost effective — You can create a twitter or a Facebook account for free and a Facebook business page is also zero cost. This will help you to create valuable and high-quality content which you can share with your followers. Just a tip: People always appreciate good content; so deliver the same and you will get good reach in no time. 8. Monitor and Control — It is easy and effortless to control and maintain your social media account. In this way; you can always monitor; edit; repost and engage without much apprehension because you are always in control of your account. In addition to this; social media is accessible and portable. You can take care of your brand’s social media account from any corner of the world. 9. Opportunities — Your brand’s enhanced social presence is surely going to attract new opportunities for you. It may appear in any form- as business opportunities or a lot of new customer opportunities. Example: You are a caterer. A customer in the local area looks up on Facebook for ‘caterers’. Your brand name pops up with several 5-star reviews and tons of Facebook page likes. The prospective customer will take a look at the page and contact you for further details. This can happen in many ways for various types of industries. 10. Launch products/services — After creating a solid follower base; you can get to launch products/services directly on social media networks (live or not). This will create a ripple of engagement with your present customers; attract new customers and help your brand gain a lot of attention. Also; this will direct a lot of traffic towards your website and in the end; result in more sales. These are some of the crucial reasons as to why social media will make your business more prosperous and better. Thanks for reading.

4 Benefits of an Online Savings Account — Tejesh Kodali,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write 4 Benefits of an Online Savings Account — Tejesh Kodali Tejesh Kodali · Follow 2 min read · Jan 2; 2019 -- For anyone; the idea of being able to make more money and secure your financial stability is appealing. People are constantly looking for side hustles to earn more money and ways to save the money they’ve already made. In the last few years; online banks and savings accounts have risen in popularity and offer a fantastic solution to traditional banking. While many people are wary of using a solely online bank and trusting their money to that entity; with research; you can find a great bank that provides better benefits than those of a brick-and-mortar financial institution. Better interest For most people; the greatest appeal of an online bank is that you’ll have a much greater interest rate for your savings account. Since an online bank does not have to worry about the cost of maintaining physical bank locations and hiring hundreds of employees; they’re able to offer a greater interest rate for your money; some as high as 2.0%. This number is incredibly appealing when compared to the average interest rate at a traditional bank; which is around 0.04%. Many people opt to continue to use a traditional bank for their checking account; but put their savings in an online account. Equal security Many are under the false assumption that online banks are simply not safe. However; online banks and traditional banks both have about the same amount of online security risks; since even traditional banks offer online banking. In order to make sure your money is as safe as possible; double check that the online bank you’re considering working with is FDIC insured and take security measures such as only accessing your account from secure WiFi and regularly changing your password. More options While online banks usually do not provide as many options such as various types of checking and savings accounts; loans; or insurance options; there are plenty of banks you can choose from for a savings (or a basic checking) account. Online banks have to compete with one another to offer the best options; interest rates; and security; so you have plenty to choose from. Take your time to do your research and see what institution best meets your financial needs. Convenience Another great perk is the convenience that many online banks offer. Most established online banks have agreements with ATM networks that allow users to access thousands of ATMs without paying a fee. You can also easily manage your money online and make transactions between other financial accounts. Originally published at tejeshkodali.net on January 2; 2019.

Londres pone en marcha un ambicioso programa de reconocimiento facial,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write Londres pone en marcha un ambicioso programa de reconocimiento facial Balam Seguridad Privada · Follow 2 min read · Jan 2; 2019 -- La Navidad ya se divisa en el horizonte y las grandes ciudades europeas se preparan para acoger las tradicionales -y multitudinarias- celebraciones que acompañan a tan entrañables fechas. Por desgracia; distintos factores han motivado que la seguridad haya escalado posiciones en la planificación de cualquier evento navideño. Londres ha ido un paso más allá y ha diseñado un ambicioso programa de reconocimiento facial para identificar a cualquier posible sospechoso que se adentre en el centro de la ciudad. ¿Una medida necesaria o excesiva? El debate está servido. La Policía londinense desarrollará durante la Navidad una campaña de reconocimiento facial que tendrá dos líneas de actuación. En primer lugar; se creará un amplio fichero con los rostros de aquellos transeúntes que deseen participar en el programa. Para ello; agentes policiales debidamente identificados solicitarán a los ciudadanos que se dejen escanear el rostro. De este modo; los británicos contribuirán a agilizar el trabajo de la Policía a la hora de controlar grandes masas de personas. La segunda parte de la campaña consistirá en la instalación de cámaras de vídeo con la tecnología de reconocimiento facial integrada. Hasta aquí; las ventajas de la campaña son evidentes. Los agentes de Policía que están trabajando desde los diferentes centros de control pueden seguir en tiempo real la situación de las calles londinenses y; cuando aparezca un sospechoso; el sistema de reconocimiento facial activará la alarma pertinente. Conviene recordar que Reino Unido ha sufrido varios atentados terroristas de carácter islamista en los últimos años; al tiempo que el inminente Brexit ha generado una mayor sensación de inseguridad entre buena parte de la población. Con todo; tan invasivo protocolo de vigilancia no ha gustado a todos. La organización Big Brother Watch ha calificado el nuevo operativo policial londinense como “autoritario; peligroso e ilegal”. Autoritario porque supone ceder a las autoridades la potestad de reconocernos en cualquier situación y sin que medie una orden judicial (en principio; de manera voluntaria). Peligroso porque una cesión de ese calibre puede volverse en nuestra contra si alguien logra hackear el sistema de vigilancia. Ilegal porque; salvo que se modifique la legislación vigente (y no está previsto un movimiento en este sentido; no es lícito grabar a los transeúntes de manera indiscriminada. Por ahora; los policías de Londres sortean este último obstáculo con la petición formal a los ciudadanos para que colaboren con el operativo. La seguridad es una de nuestras grandes preocupaciones y en este espacio te comentaremos qué papel puede jugar la tecnología. Originally published at balamseguridad.net on January 2; 2019.

Human Genomic Databases need more minority participation,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write Human Genomic Databases need more minority participation Jaymie White · Follow Published in Supplierty News · 2 min read · Jan 2; 2019 www.suppliertynews.com We are currently undergoing a major transition in the STEM field of genomic research. While some people may look at the word genomes and immediately think genetics there is a difference. According to WHO; “The main difference between genomics and genetics is that genetics scrutinizes the functioning and composition of the single gene where as genomics addresses all genes and their inter relationships in order to identify their combined influence on the growth and development of the organism.” Identifying their combined influence is key in today’s scientific market. What doctors around the world are now learning pertains to the importance of ethnic diversity in clinical trial research. “Human genomic databases — collections of all the genetic information that has been sequenced over the years — are” heavily skewed to people of European descent; making it harder to correctly diagnose medical issues for non-Europeans. According to Scientific American; “The community has learned that there are far more of these larger; so-called structural variations than expected. These are now known to cause genetic disease and impact the way drugs are metabolized by individuals and ethnic populations.” Due to this revelation; there is now a push to include more minorities in clinical trials. The necessity of this is at an all time high as. An example of specific medical issues effecting a specific ethnic group can be seen in the Korean genome project which “found a population-specific variant in a gene that regulates how some medications are metabolized by the body; this is essential information for dosing and for gauging the likelihood that a patient will respond to a particular therapy.” The National Institutes of Health is currently pushing forward with an effort called “All of Us” which “aims to sequence a diverse sampling of Americans across gender; sexual orientation; ethnicity and race. Being inclusive is an essential goal of this program; and participation is free so as to open the doors to anyone who wants to join.” Understanding more genomic data is essential to correctly diagnosing future medical issues and a must for minorities; who are underrepresented within these databases.

Web-based Tech Support,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write Web-based Tech Support WebserveBlogs · Follow 4 min read · Jan 2; 2019 -- Why You Must Invest in Web-based Tech Support Web-based tech support is now ubiquitous and radically improving the way customers interact with businesses. It is quick; easy; time-saving and cost-effective. If you are still contemplating getting a customer care system in place that heavily inclines towards a web base; here is a little guide for you to understand the various means of going about it; the advantages and disadvantages of the system and how to avoid the latter. Web-based tech support is now ubiquitous and radically improving the way customers interact with businesses. It is quick; easy; time-saving and cost-effective. If you are still contemplating getting a customer care system in place that heavily inclines towards a web base; here is a little guide for you to understand the various means of going about it; the advantages and disadvantages of the system and how to avoid the latter. Get Thoroughly Informative Content The first and a very crucial step towards developing a robust web-based tech support system is getting precise content in place for all the answers people may be seeking. Use your own experience in the business to put together a list of the commonest queries your customers may have and get some answers ready for the same. Be it through dedicated web pages for specific issues or through a page of Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ); invest in content that readily resolves concerns. Look at it as an investment that lets you save countless hours in having to respond individually to each customer. Troubleshooting Forms Just like the previous step of filing FAQs; this one would need you to come up with common complain points and create troubleshooting forms based on them. Make sure they are easy to understand and ask for only as much information as is necessary towards troubleshooting an issue. Too long and complicated forms are always a major turnoff for people. Live Chats Chats are an excellent replacement for phone calls. It makes it easy for consumers to make their complaints — they can contact the customer support team from anywhere at any time in situations where they cannot get on a call. And on the other side; chat also makes it easier for troubleshooting professionals to multi-task between various customers. So it’s a win-win. Should you want to go one step ahead and install a system that is available 24*7 for your customers; a chatbot can be a good idea. Many big and mid-sized companies now have AI-based chat support for their consumers and it’s fetching them good returns on investment. The Benefits of Web Based Customer Support Reduced Wait Times for Customers Call support is ridden by a massive issue of queue times for people — this holds especially true if you have a busy stream of support queries coming in every day. Many a time; wait times are so long that many people drop the call mid-way and complain about how poor the customer service of the company is. With web-based support; you can completely eliminate this problem. Customers can instantly get the static content on troubleshooting and write in to the chat support in case they need further assistance. Avoidance of Multiple Call Transfers For companies with various departments; the necessity to transfer a call from one department to another occurs often. This results in customers having to repeat the details of their problem over and over again to various executives; not to mention the frequent technical glitches involved in transferring calls. Online support helps get this straight by ensuring that the same set of information about a customer query is available to all and the customer only has to feed the information once. Better Record Keeping An extension of the last point; form or chat-based support allows for excellent record keeping of the complainant’s data. What the customer says once about the problem is saved in real time and can be accessed any time later for aiding in the troubleshooting process. On the other hand; recording phone calls and listening to them for assistance is nowhere as efficient as accessing written data. Customers Can Reach You from Anywhere in the World Making a call may not always be a possibility for everyone — people who are traveling internationally; for instance; may not have the required phone connection — or else they may be in a different time zone. Wi-Fi; however; is generally available and makes communicating through the Internet far easier and cheaper. So offering internet based tech support will be a boon for people on the go. The Greatest Disadvantage: Data Leak Risks Leakage of sensitive data has occurred so many times on various popular websites that people are now wary of giving in personal information on Internet forms. Making sure you have the requisite data security in place will be of considerable help here. Also; after getting the security measures; you must mention it on your form pages that you are a completely secure platform and have a strict confidentiality policy in place to safeguard users’ information. Lack of Human Touch Another small disadvantage of web-based tech support is that customers can feel alienated. Talking to a computer may not be a very desirable situation for many people; especially those in the older demographic. A nice way to maneuver around this problem is by personalizing emails and chat responses as far as possible for different consumer personas. Also; you could include support content in the local language to make it more relatable. In any case; the advantages definitely outweigh the disadvantages; and web-based tech support is unavoidable; even if you continue to keep a calling system running to aid the former.

Presto Change-O Privacy Disappears!,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write Member-only story Presto Change-O Privacy Disappears! Canadian Civil Liberties Association · Follow 5 min read · Jan 2; 2019 -- By Brenda McPhail; Director of Privacy; Technology & Surveillance; CCLA January 3; 2019 D ecember 31 is the end of an era for Torontonians. It’s the last day; ever; that we can use a metropass on the Toronto Transit system. From January 1 2019; the Presto electronic payment system takes over; and that means that our ability to travel by bus or subway through the city untracked has radically decreased. We could buy a metropass with cash; use it every day all month by showing it to a fare collector; and no record that connected us with that card would be created. Not so with Presto. Presto; now in operation in Greater Toronto; Hamilton and Ottawa transit systems; is developing a reputation as the system we love to hate. But the gripes you hear floating around about the switch from pass to Presto are focused on the fact that the Presto system is plagued with dysfunctional card readers; auto-fill errors that leave riders unexpectedly out of funds; and vending machines that are better at taking money than spitting out new cards. These are all irritating; but they’re likely to get fixed over time. The big issue that we’re not talking much about at all is privacy — when Presto becomes the only option; anonymous travel becomes pretty much impossible. That’s because of the way the Presto system is designed; as a re-loadable card that requires people to create an account and probably link a credit card to maximize benefit and convenience. Presto is optimized to operate for identified users. When we become an account holder; benefits include the ability to cancel a card if it’s lost; the ability to check to confirm we’re only getting charged for the trips we’ve taken; and the ability to automatically re-load a card by linking it to a credit card. But all that convenience comes at a cost. Every ride is tracked. Every time we tap the card our presence is recorded. That information can be shared with police; transit safety officers or special constables; without a warrant in many cases. The records are stored for at least five years; according to the Presto terms of service. And to be clear; much of the data collection is not a necessity; it’s a design choice.

I interviewed at six top companies in Silicon Valley in six days; and stumbled into six job offers,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write I interviewed at six top companies in Silicon Valley in six days; and stumbled into six job offers Bay Area Belletrist · Follow 11 min read · Jan 3; 2019 -- 46 The gauntlet In the six days* from August 13th to August 20th; 2018; I interviewed at LinkedIn; Yelp; Apple; Amazon; Facebook; and Google and got all six job offers. Edit: follow-up post (with the $ offered) posted here! Follow my Twitter for future updates :) Levels.fyi now offers a professional negotiation service if you’re looking for help from actual recruiters (I’ve attached my affiliate link). All of the below is heavily inspired by this post from last year that originally pushed me to consider the possibility of moving companies. I didn’t want to fly across the country repeatedly to find my perfect job; so I knew I had to schedule them alongside each other and gut it out. While the roles I was specifically pursuing were mobile positions; the study approach; tips; and recommendations should be universal. Hopefully; I can inspire people that were in the same spot as me — not 100% happy with work; dreaming of life in the Bay; but lacking severely on the “study prep” front — to just go for it and see what the future brings their way. Introduction & Statistics I knew I wanted a job in the Bay Area where I could really grow from a mobile perspective at a larger company. I’ve worked at startups before and I’ve loved it; but for a few reasons; I was looking at the big fish this go-around (in terms of valuation; not strictly team size). I also knew that I wasn’t positive where I wanted to work or how much compensation I’d need to match what I’m making now. I also knew I didn’t want to apply to 100+ places like I did when I was graduating from college. All told; I applied to 20 companies. I was explicitly rejected by 4 of those companies (Reddit; Nest; Stripe; Uber) after applying. Of the remaining 16; 10 companies never responded to me either way (Lyft; Airbnb; Dropbox; Instagram; YouTube; Square; Robinhood; Twitter; Snap; Slack). Math dictates 6 companies followed up with a recruiter screen. Of those 6 companies; I was able to get phone screens with 6; onsites with 6; and offers from 6. Reviewing my Google Calendar; I believe I had (approximately): 7 recruiter screens in 10 days 7 technical screens in 11 days 29 onsite interviews in 8 days 3 follow-up phone interviews Adding up the above says I had 46 interviews in 73 days (including gaps between each step). It was exhausting and it meant that most of my lunch breaks were just interviews for multiple weeks. I had to start going into work very early so I could leave earlier to take calls at home. Making sure I was still meeting all of my commitments at work was a challenge; too; but I made sure to prioritize that over interviewing; rescheduling when necessary. I wouldn’t phone it in for the purposes of interviewing. It makes you look bad; it’s unethical; and if you don’t get a job; you’re now a lower performer. The Companies; in order LinkedIn (Sunnyvale; CA) Link to my heart rate during my onsite (normal resting rate of 60). LinkedIn’s mobile apps are actually pretty slick and they have some solid contributions to the open source community. I was very impressed throughout the entire interview process with LinkedIn from both a culture perspective and an engineering perspective. They rose the highest on my mental list of iOS Prestige™ from the start of the process until the end. Yelp (San Francisco; CA) Link to my heart rate during my onsite (normal resting rate of 60) Yelp has a really beautiful app with tons of iOS subtleties that show an understanding of the platform. I loved the vibe onsite. They have a beautiful building and I’d love to work with any of my interviewers. They’re much smaller than any of the other companies I applied to and it showed in all of the good ways. It seemed very tight knit and the process moved fast. Apple (Cupertino; CA) Link to my heart rate during my onsite (normal resting rate of 60) Apple’s been an important part of iOS for a while (har har). I grew up an extreme Apple fanboy (since the age of 12; at least). The Mac originally got me into programming. The iPhone SDK encouraged me to build and ship my first app. It was absolutely surreal to have them invite me onsite and later extend me an offer. I don’t know what else there is to say on that front. Amazon (Palo Alto; CA) Link to my heart rate during my onsite (normal resting rate of 60) I wouldn’t consider Amazon a “mobile-first” as a company (at all). This position/team; though; met the criteria I laid out to start. I wasn’t in love with the Palo Alto building I was in specifically; but it’s a temporary office until they move into a more Amazon-y building; so it’s mostly poor interview timing on that front. The people I spoke to seemed pretty dedicated to their product. Although every company loved telling me that “it really feels like a startup!”; it rang the truest at Amazon. Facebook (Menlo Park; CA) Link to my heart rate during my onsite (normal resting rate of 60) I interviewed Facebook’s newest building. I thought it was really cool overall; although I’m somewhat hazy on the details about how the interview itself went because I was on my fifth consecutive day of interviewing with inadequate sleep. I do remember really enjoying the people I spoke with and having a very insightful lunch interview. Google (Mountain View; CA) Link to my heart rate during my onsite (normal resting rate of 60) Google; to my understanding; does pretty “generic” interviews for a given role. I spoke to a lot of members from one of Google’s biggest products on iOS; but I wasn’t interviewing for a position specifically with that team. After I passed through Google’s hiring committee I moved on to the team matching phase and ultimately matched up with a team. It’s a very loooooong process relative to the rest of the companies I spoke with; so I definitely had to keep everyone updated on where Google was. I also had to let Google know where I was with everyone else. Study Plan To be clear; I was starting from a position where I could probably do most Leetcode Easy problems in ~30 minutes; and I could maybe solve 25% of Leetcode Medium problems with infinite time. Solving Leetcode Hard problems were akin to trying to solve P=NP. In short; I had a large gap to bridge. To study algorithms I began first with Cracking the Coding Interview. On Sunday mornings I’d wake up and go to a coffee shop and grind out some problems in Objective-C. Once I did enough problems in CtCI (I think I solved ~35 problems) I would review a handful of Leetcode problems in the chapters I’d gone over. After a few weeks of this; I felt I had “the basics” down and moved on to my next phase. With the basics down; I moved on to Elements of Programming Interviews. This book is considerably more difficult than CtCI. The book has recommended study plans that I stuck pretty closely with. I think there was one that planned on four weeks of studying and I got through almost all of it. It is critical; in my opinion; to either whiteboard problems with someone or mock a phone interview with someone. Not critical as in “very important”; but critical as in you should consider it an absolute requirement when studying. I’m sure you can get a job without it; but it’s the single best form of practice I had. If anyone wants to mock phone interviews for iOS I’d be happy to help out — you may be able to find me on CS Career Hackers and maybe we can work something out; time permitting. If not me; there are plenty of others there willing to help out. It’ll be awkward. That’s the point. If it were natural you wouldn’t need to practice it; would you? If you start practicing on the phone or on a whiteboard and it’s embarrassing or awkward; it’s a sign you’re doing exactly what you should be: practicing. It was pretty awkward for me until it wasn’t; and the practice absolutely paid off. After about a month of consistently practicing problems each day (maybe 2–3 hours/day; more on weekends) I moved on to doing primarily Leetcode’s “Top Interview Questions”. I didn’t do them all but I did “enough”. The key to preparing algorithm interviews is to get yourself to a point that you can figure out a problem during the interview; not necessarily to know how to do every problem. That’s impossible. Almost all of the questions I heard over my week of onsites were “new” to me yet similar to questions I’d seen. That’s how most development goes in the industry; too. You have a lot of similar problems but your particular use case has special constraints. Lessons Learned I’m going to present a bunch of lessons I learned as bullet points in no particular order. Everything listed below is something I wish I knew beforehand; both in terms of preparation on the technical side and in terms of scheduling and other non-technical tips. These lessons are not iOS-specific and I’d imagine are generally applicable to all interviews in our industry. 📚 Stick with it. When I was looking for a job out of school I gave up after one or two weeks of studying. I reasoned that I simply was not cut out to learn the stuff. There was minimal progress from when I first started for weeks; so what was the point of wasting any more time? This time around; I figured I didn’t have a choice. Eventually; things started falling into place. It’s a lot of work; but the willingness to learn is what separates successful candidates from the rest. 🤓 Practice is almost everything. You certainly need a baseline of innate ability; but practice (i.e. learning) can fill in very wide ability gaps. Companies don’t hire people based on the knowledge they were born with. They hire those that can perform their duties and perform them well; regardless of where/when they cultivated the knowledge. 👫 Practicing with a friend is everything else. Whether on a whiteboard or on something like Codeshare; simulating an interview environment with someone over a period of time takes a lot of the scariness out of interviews. You get over the awkwardness of verbalizing something totally stupid to someone because your brain slipped. The best is if you can make sure someone understands a problem you haven’t seen before; as they can give you hints to push you toward a solution. Seriously; that kind of practice is invaluable. 📊 It’s a numbers game. You can practice — effectively; even — and not land a job because the right person didn’t see your resumé or you just didn’t see a solution to a whiteboard problem in time. The best you can hope to do is maximize your odds. This means applying everywhere you would like to work and fit a job req and not just your top choice. I applied for my top 20! 🤔 Focus on the problem solving; not the solution. Memorization isn’t enough. Of ~20 algorithm problems I saw in a week I had seen maybe one of the problems before (and I let my interviewer know; though many would disagree with that choice). I just saw lots of common patterns and I was able to come up with solutions on the fly. 😣 Don’t get discouraged. There were multiple interviews I had where I didn’t know the solution and interviewers had to shepherd me towards a solution. I still got offers from everywhere I interviewed. Also; I felt I absolutely bombed one of my interviews (four of my five that day I thought were solid “no hires”) and the company later extended me an offer. Anything can happen; evidently. :) 🤯 Don’t be quick to disregard problems. There were multiple times I was practicing with a friend of mine and he shrugged off particularly difficult problems as pointless to know. Curiously enough; of the four types of problems I recall him saying would “never” come up; two of them did. Not in the exact form we were going to practice; but very similar. If your practice shows a certain concept come up frequently; learn it. 🧐 Don’t underestimate the importance of behavioral questions. I think I enjoyed a lot of success because my (honest) answers were what companies wanted. It’s my theory that many developers have strong technical skills and still struggle to find their perfect job because they’re rude; dishonest; or uncomfortable speaking to people outside of a technical setting. These are all justifiable reasons to reject a candidate; in my opinion. Practice them just as you would technical questions. 🧠 If you know more; show it. There were multiple examples during my onsites where I would answer a question and mention some other knowledge I had but explain that I didn’t have time in an interview to fully implement that solution. Answering a question about strings? Show off your Unicode knowledge with your solution or explain how to support Unicode. Implementing a private method? Talk about the Objective-C conventions for methods. Updating a table view? Talk about the different animations you can support. Don’t bring something up if you can’t talk all about it; but if you can; it allows you to show knowledge outside of the narrow window provided by the question and gives you a leg up on anyone that sticks strictly to the beaten path. 💪 Don’t strive to clear the bar; strive to set it. Interview performance obviously helps decide if you get an offer from a given company; but it also helps decide what that offer looks like. If you get to a point where you think you know enough to get an offer; that’s great. But keep in mind there’s a big difference between “barely good enough” and “absolutely good enough”. Strive for the latter! My initial (i.e. not negotiated) offers came in pretty solid despite my relative lack of experience and I believe interview performance played a big role. Wrap-Up So that’s that! It was a crazy ride and I have no regrets. I truly; genuinely hope that the above can help someone get over the hump when it comes to landing a job they’ve dreamed about. If there’s particular interest in iOS-specific help; I can publish some tips; so please comment and let me know. If it’s of any use: I was interviewing for my second job out of college with about two and a half years of experience without any particularly notable internships or employers on my resume; I went to a very small school that had zero known software companies at their “career fair”; I started preparing in late April and started applying in June/July; and; lastly; a few months in; my job is everything I could have possibly dreamed of. I’d like to shout out the CS Career Hackers community one last time. If you’re looking for a place to practice and talk with others in similar situations (or those that have been through it on either side); please do check it out. 👍 I didn’t find it until a few months after I signed my offer; but it’s a great place nonetheless. Happy studying; everyone! ok; technically; it was six weekdays and eight days; no; I didn’t interview on a Saturday :) 📝 Read this story later in Journal. 👩‍💻 Wake up every Sunday morning to the week’s most noteworthy stories in Tech waiting in your inbox.

What Is a Pure Function in JavaScript?,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write Member-only story What Is a Pure Function in JavaScript? Yazeed Bzadough · Follow Published in We’ve moved to freeCodeCamp.org/news · 5 min read · Jan 4; 2019 -- 9 Pure functions are the atomic building blocks in functional programming. They are adored for their simplicity and testability. This post covers a quick checklist to tell if a function’s pure or not. The Checklist A function must pass two tests to be considered “pure”: Same inputs always return same outputs No side-effects Let’s zoom in on each one. 1. Same Input => Same Output Compare this: const add = (x; y) => x + y; add(2; 4); // 6 To this: let x = 2; const add = (y) => {   x += y; }; add(4); // x === 6 (the first time) Pure Functions = Consistent Results The first example returns a value based on the given parameters; regardless of where/when you call it. If you pass 2 and 4; you’ll always get 6. Nothing else affects the output. Impure Functions = Inconsistent Results The second example returns nothing. It relies on shared state to do its job by incrementing a variable outside of its own scope. This pattern is a developer’s nightmare fuel. Shared state introduces a time dependency. You get different results depending on when you called the function. The first time results in 6; next time is 10 and so on. Which Version’s Easier to Reason About? Which one’s less likely to breed bugs that happen only under certain conditions? Which one’s more likely to succeed in a multi-threaded environment where time dependencies can break the system? Definitely the first one. 2.

720 Free Online Programming & Computer Science Courses You Can Start in January,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write 720 Free Online Programming & Computer Science Courses You Can Start in January Dhawal Shah · Follow Published in We’ve moved to freeCodeCamp.org/news · 27 min read · Jan 3; 2019 -- Seven years ago; universities like MIT and Stanford first opened up free online courses to the public. Today; more than 850 schools around the world have created thousands of free online courses; popularly known as Massive Open Online Courses or MOOCs. I’ve compiled this list of 720 such free online courses that you can start this month. For this; I leveraged Class Central’s database of over 11;000 courses. I’ve also included each course’s average rating. Class Central’s home page. I’ve sorted these courses into the following categories based on their difficulty level: Beginner Intermediate Advanced Courses that are being offered for the first time are marked as [NEW]. Many of these courses are completely self-paced. The rest will start at various times later in January. You can find complete lists of the technology-related courses starting later in 2019 on Class Central’s Computer Science; Data Science; and Programming subject pages. I understand this a long list and might be daunting for learners new to programming. In that case; you might find David Venturi’s recommendations for the best Data Science online courses useful — even if you’re not looking to learn Data Science. I hope to create more of these guides in the future.

What’s going on? Colin Horgan · Follow 8 min read · Jan 4; 2019 3.2K 10 Protesters gather in Long Island City to say “No” to the Amazon HQ2 decision on November 14; 2018; in Long Island City; New York. Photo: Don Emmert/AFP/Getty Images T hree days after Christmas; Twitter user Kilgore Trout (with over 51;000 followers) tweeted a link to a GoFundMe fundraising page; writing; “hello I am catching the crowdfunding wave but also being extremely honest please contribute today.” The reason for the GoFundMe page? “I Am Just Taking Your Money. There Is No Reason;” the fundraising page put it. GoFundMe eventually took the page down; but not before it raised $69 (“the perfect RIP;” Trout tweeted). The page was clearly a joke; but one that resonated in the waning days of 2018; a year in which it seemed like just about everything was being exposed as a scam. Kilgore Trout’s GoFundMe; for instance; appeared only days after another fundraising attempt on the site was revealed as a $400;000 scam. In autumn 2017; a young couple from New Jersey set up a page to raise money for a man they claimed was a destitute war veteran who they said gave the woman his last $20 so she could refill her gas tank. Before the story was exposed as a complete fabrication; the couple had been featured prominently by major media outlets that attached themselves to a heartwarming viral tale. But that was hardly the largest alleged scam to hit the news. There was the story of Anna Sorokin (aka Anna Delvey); who New York magazine profiled in May. For many months; Sorokin duped Manhattan’s young high-flyers into believing she was one of them — a mysterious heiress with untold inherited financial resources. Under her assumed identity; Sorokin (who had; in reality; been raised in a middle-class German family and had no trust fund to speak of) ran up hotel bills in the tens of thousands; dined with celebrities; and attempted to secure millions in financing from major international banks to create what she described as a “dynamic visual-arts center” in New York City. Then there was Facebook. The site’s seemingly unending list of scandals combined to suggest one thing: that it is not what it has portrayed itself to be. Rather than a space to build relationships; or even a better world; exposé after exposé gradually revealed the social platform to be… Create an account to read the full story.

How a Feel-Good AI Story Went Wrong in Flint,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write Member-only story How a Feel-Good AI Story Went Wrong in Flint A machine-learning model showed promising results; but city officials and their engineering contractor abandoned it Alexis C. Madrigal · Follow Published in The Atlantic · 14 min read · Jan 4; 2019 1.3K 7 Workers in Flint; Michigan; replace a lead water-service pipe. Photo: Bill Pugliano/Getty Images M ore than a thousand days after the water problems in Flint; Michigan; became national news; thousands of homes in the city still have lead pipes; from which the toxic metal can leach into the water supply. To remedy the problem; the lead pipes need to be replaced with safer; copper ones. That sounds straightforward; but it is a challenge to figure out which homes have lead pipes in the first place. The City’s records are incomplete and inaccurate. And digging up all the pipes would be costly and time-consuming. That’s just the kind of problem that automation is supposed to help solve. So volunteer computer scientists; with some funding from Google; designed a machine-learning model to help predict which homes were likely to have lead pipes. The artificial intelligence was supposed to help the City dig only where pipes were likely to need replacement. Through 2017; the plan was working. Workers inspected 8;833 homes; and of those; 6;228 homes had their pipes replaced — a 70 percent rate of accuracy. Heading into 2018; the City signed a big; national engineering firm; AECOM; to a $5 million contract to “accelerate” the program; holding a buoyant community meeting to herald the arrival of the cavalry in Flint. Few cities have embarked on a pipe-replacement program nearly as ambitious; let alone those that have to deal with the effects of segregation; environmental racism; and the collapse of industry in the upper Midwest. In total; 18;786 families in Flint now know that their pipes are safe; because the City has either dug them up and confirmed that they’re copper or replaced them if they were made of lead or galvanized steel. “I think things have gone extremely well;” Flint Mayor Karen Weaver told me. “We’re a year ahead of schedule and under budget.” But something strange happened over the course of 2018: As more and more people had their pipes evaluated in 2018; fewer and fewer inspections were finding lead pipes. In November 2017; according to meeting notes obtained by local news outlet MLive’s Zahra Ahmad; the city’s head of public worksestimated that about 10;000 of Flint’s homes… Create an account to read the full story.

Sensory Porn Is Taking Over The Internet And Corrupting Our Children,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write Sensory Porn Is Taking Over The Internet And Corrupting Our Children Gordy Bal · Follow 12 min read · Jan 3; 2019 -- 1 “It has become appallingly obvious that our technology has exceeded our humanity.” — Albert Einstein This time of year; it feels blatantly more obvious how much time we spend with technology. It’s also a time where we reflect on the past year; and aim to make changes for the next that will improve our lives. In this age of social media; we have more platforms than ever targeting us with ads and messages. On one hand; it’s an amazing opportunity for awesome brands to get their name out to consumers who actually have the want and need for their products. But on the other hand; there are more subtle sales tactics being used to target the younger audience; that not only manipulate thoughts; but actually alter our body and brain chemistry. Scary; I know. When my 6 year old son said he wanted to watch a YouTube video that he’d seen at his friends; I was curious and obliging. After some digging; he found the one; and played it for me. My immediate reaction was confusion; followed by concern. See for yourself. When I saw this; I got a serious case of the heebie jeebies. Firstly; I’d never seen my child quite so captivated by anything (let alone someone unwrapping a toy). And secondly; I could immediately tell there was a tactic being used to cause this captivation in such a young; susceptible mind. That’s when I recalled hearing about Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response. Also known on the internet as ASMR. Which I noted coincidentally appears directly in this Youtube channels name - AWESMR kids. A channel that has over 4.9M subscribers and over 3.5 BILLION video views. So What Is ASMR? “Boredom; rooted in a fundamental discomfort with the self; is one of the least tolerable mental states.” — Gabor Mate ASMR is an experience characterized by a tingling sensation on the skin that typically begins on the scalp and moves down the back of the neck and upper spine. In simpler terms; it’s a pleasurable physical reaction caused by a sound stimuli. When searched on the Google; top results include: Gentle Whispering ASMR ASMR Helping You Fall Asleep In Bed ASMR Ear Massage and Brushing Although a fairly new internet phenomena; the actual cause and effect of ASMR is nothing new. In fact; Craig Richard; PhD and author of Brain Tingles: The Secret to Triggering Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response for Improved Sleep; Stress Relief; and Head-to-Toe Euphoria; thinks it’s a genetic response that’s designed to mitigate stress hormones and help us feel relaxed. So much so; that ASMR has been coined as the “Brain Orgasm”. That made me curious — what happens when you continuously stimulate this neurological pleasure response unnaturally? In a survey led by Dr. Richard; 40% of 19;000 respondents reported that their experiences from watching ASMR had decreased or gone away overtime. The same way pornography stimulates a response in the body that would naturally be promoted by sex; ASMR stimulates a response in the body that would be naturally promoted by an experience; such as a mother soothing their child; or brushing their hair. And just like pornography; it appears that desensitization is a common result of overstimulation; killing the “Brain Orgasm” for many ASMR fans. Why Does This Scare Me? It’s becoming seemingly more difficult to distinguish pleasure and pain. I; myself struggle with knowing that a lot of today’s wellness “trends” are so new; we have no idea what they’re actually doing to our mental and physical health. And more importantly; our children’s — especially when they are still growing and in a fundamental time of brain development. As a huge believer in the Quantified Self Movement; I’m interested in self-knowledge through self-tracking. I encourage using technology for the benefit of humanity and am a supporter of many technologies that are not only improving our mental; emotional; physical and spiritual wellbeing; but the wellbeing of the planet. And yet research is showing that there’s no way around it — screen time damages the brain; and in turn has detrimental impact on mental; emotional and physical wellbeing. “Much of the damage occurs in the brain’s frontal lobe; which undergoes massive changes from puberty until the mid-twenties. Frontal lobe development; in turn; largely determines success in every area of life — from sense of well-being to academic or career success to relationship skills.” Think back to sugar. When we were growing up; our parents unknowingly subjected us to it through unlimited cereals; cookies; soft drinks; etc. Only now is research showing the devastating impact it has on brain health; diabetes and heart disease; not to mention it’s extremely addictive nature. The equivalent will be true with screen time — in 30 years from now; research will begin to show more clearly just how damaging excess screen time is on mental; emotional and physical health. And the children who grew up glued to the screen will be disadvantaged; the same way the ones who ate unlimited sugar are. Although seemingly harmless; these addictive ASMR videos are desensitizing us from natural pleasure and altering our brain chemistry. The statistics are shocking; and yet its not surprising. Unlimited content is now at our children’s fingertips; and it’s targeting them in an extremely manipulative and addictive way. In an article titled “Youtube’s Dark Side Could Be Affecting Your Child’s Mental Health” a clear chart shows the percentage of children choosing the unknown and unlimited world Youtube over structured TV. We are moving towards a world where we have little to no control over technology and its effects on us. Not only is it being used to catch our attention; but it’s being used to alter our physical chemistry and the way we see the world. And it seems like the people with the most fear and caution around the technology we use every day are the ones who are creating it. Bill Gates and Steve Jobs are two examples of parents who limit their children’s screen time. Just this alone is reason enough to question the devices that have become an extension of our bodies and consume so much of our time. So What Can We Do About It? “The most important part about tomorrow is not the technology or the automation; but that man is going to come into entirely new relationships with his fellow men. He will retain much more in his everyday life of what we term the naïveté and idealism of the child. I think the way to see what tomorrow is going to look like is just to look at our children.” — R. Buckminster Fuller It’s not completely hopeless. The more awareness we have around what’s happening; the more we can control its effect on us and the people we love. Especially our children. Children are a blank canvas; yet they come into the world with a knowing far greater than we give them credit for. Very quickly; children learn what is good for them and what is harmful. They also watch and listen to us closely; and pick up on our behaviours. Have you ever said something while your child was in the room; not thinking about them being around. And then later that day they repeat that exact sentence or bring it up in another way? It’s not surprising really — Children’s brains are like sponges; ready to absorb whatever is in front of them. Making it that much more important to be conscious of what we expose them to. And in turn; not only do we avoid having to sit through painfully numbing Youtube videos; but we also reap the benefits of making better choices for their lives. Here are 4 things you can do to positively alter your child’s relationship with technology. 1. Choose Nature Over Screen Time. “Nature cures; not the physician” — Hippocrates Too often we forget what is right in front of us. In a world where we have millions of videos at our fingertips; and a pocketful of games on our device at any second; it is easy to look past our true nature — Nature. But spending time outside is incredibly important for mental; emotional and physical wellbeing. There is even now a word that describes this innate instinct — Biophilia: The innate human need to connect with nature. And it’s not some far out idea; study after study shows that our disconnect from nature is causing an increase in anxiety and depression; as well as a slew of other physical and mental challenges. No wonder our children are experiencing mental health issues younger; we are replacing their natural instinct for connection with a stimulating screen. So it’s simple; choose nature! Next time you have an hour to spare or a week of holiday’s; choose to spend more of that time outside; connecting with your children and to nature. You may feel the cold more than your kids; but you will also experience this unbeatable joy of watching them interact in their most natural state. 2. Limit Blue Light Exposure When Using Devices “Technology is; of course; a double edged sword. Fire can cook our food but also burn us.” — Jason Silva There’s no way to completely avoid exposure to technology and the internet. Even if there was; that wouldn’t be the answer. We are living in an age of exponential technology. It’s advancing faster than we can keep up with; making it that much more important to learn how to balance its effects. As our children’s exposure continues to grow; they will inevitably encounter things we wish they wouldn’t. That’s something we can learn to accept within ourselves; and trust in their values and innate knowing to guide the way. What we can do now; is protect our children’s physical and mental body; and instil healthy habits that they can grow with. I’m sure you’ve heard of blue light; and either feared it or brushed it off as nothing (no judgement either way). Here’s a simple explanation so you’re in the know. First of all; it’s everywhere — Sunlight is actually the main source of blue light (it also contains red; orange; yellow; green and every shade in between). But what we’re focused on here; is the manmade blue light coming from most of our devices. Although blue light is important in regulating our circadian rhythm; too much blue light late at night can disrupt this cycle; and cause trouble sleeping and daytime fatigue. Another key point about blue light is that our eyes are not very good at blocking it. It’s the shortest; yet highest energy wavelength; causing it to flicker more easily. This flickering leads to eye strain; headaches; mental and physical fatigue; and potential long-term loss of vision. Before the age of 10; children’s eyes are not fully developed and much more susceptible to the negative effects that come along with screen time; making it that much more important to protect them from the potentially harmful effects. Like I mentioned before; it’s too early in the game to know the exact effects; so precaution is always advised. Luckily; more and more conscious technology is coming out that can protect us and our children from these effects. So invest in blue light screen protectors for your devices or blue light glasses that your child can wear whenever they’re having screen time. Not only is this a physical layer of protection; but it becomes a conscious reminder of the time we spend on electronic devices. 3. Be Present With Your Child and Technology. “This is the real secret of life — to be completely engaged with what you are doing in the here and now. And instead of calling it work; realize it is play.” — Alan Watts It’s all too easy to give our children screen time as a way to get some peace and quiet at home or on the go — I do it too. But recently; I’ve found the quiet to be more disturbing than comforting. Seeing my children numb out to endless videos on a screen is incredibly disheartening; especially after seeing the stark contrast of joy and light on their faces when they’re physically playing games or outside. Not only do I find the numbing concerning; but now with Youtube; there is no way to filter the content they’re exposed to. I was shocked when I read about malicious content being uploaded on Youtube specifically directed to children; in the form of their favourite cartoons. There are thousands of these videos being uploaded daily; receiving millions of views by children; and Youtube can’t keep up with filtering the ones with exploitive content. Yes; it’s incredibly sad that this is the reality of our world to begin with. But it’s also a harsh reminder of our need for awareness; presence and raised consciousness. When it comes to my children and my own state of mind; the answer I’ve found most useful is being present with them every day; including during screen time. Only watching videos when myself or my wife can watch too; and using this time for inquiry; exploration and curiosity. Not only does this ensure the content consumed is positive; but it brings a level of connection into an otherwise isolating activity. 4. Avoid Using Screen Time As A Reward “If you finish all of your dinner; you can watch TV tonight”. Have you ever heard a sentence like this come out of your mouth; and then immediately wished you hadn’t or felt some sort of guilt over using this tactic to get what you want? I’m not asking this to blame or guilt — I’m raising my hand right with you. Parenting is the hardest (and most rewarding) job; and technology seems to have made it slightly easier in exhaustive situations. Part of the work I’ve done on myself has revolved around understanding why I react in certain situations and what these triggers mean as an individual and a parent. And one thing I’ve come to know; is that it’s never about my child and always about something within me. Dr. Shefali puts it beautifully: May you be blessed with a child who defies you; so you may learn to release control. Who doesn’t listen; so you may learn to tune in. Who loves to procrastinate; so you learn beauty of stillness. Who forgets things; so you learn to let go of attachments. Who is extra-sensitive; so you learn to be grounded. Who is inattentive; so you learn to be focused. Who dares to rebel; so you learn to think outside the box. Who feels afraid; so you learn to trust the Universe. May you be blessed with a child who teaches you it is never about them; and all about you. If you’d hoped I would have an answer for a reward in replace of screen time; I don’t. But I do urge you to look within and see your children as the whole; complete beings they are. Ones who innately create science experiments out of the contents of your fridge; and turn cardboard boxes into spaceships. Ones who only need love to thrive; and yearn for connection with you and the world around them. These are the future scientists and engineers and healers who will improve our planet. It’s Clear; The World As We Know It Is Changing We can see this as a bad thing; or we can see this as the shift humanity needs to improve the future of the planet. A shift that starts with our children. “Children are one third of our population and all of our future.” Which leads me to questioning how the education system has remained the same as 100 years ago; when the world has changed so much? And why do we still put our children in a structure that was made to turn out factory workers? I dive deeper into these questions in a previous article titled This Is How We’re Failing Our Children; but it’s a conversation I want to continue having for the future of our children. A conversation that led me to one of my greatest missions yet — creating a new paradigm school called Xploration Centre. Xploration Centre is built on the principles of Love; Nature and Emerging Technology; where every child is known and cherished for who they are; where the purpose of the entire curriculum is to cultivate the genius in every child and find ways for that genius to serve and benefit the community at large. Children learn key values such as critical thinking; collaboration; curiosity and consciousness; so that they become creative problem-solvers in the world that is emerging. In this way; they aren’t enslaved by technology; rather they learn how to work synergistically alongside it. If this newfound possibility is exciting for you; reach out — I’d love to hear from you!

The Biggest Tech Trends of 2019; According to Top Experts,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write Member-only story The Biggest Tech Trends of 2019; According to Top Experts Next year’s AI; AR; and 5G tech may set the stage for some massive tectonic shifts in tech and culture Fast Company · Follow Published in Fast Company · 10 min read · Jan 3; 2019 499 3 Photo: Daniel Chen/Unsplash By Mark Sullivan F or the tech industry; 2019 may be more about laying groundwork than historic breakthroughs. But it should be a busy and exciting year; as key new technologies begin finding their way into real; useful applications. The smartphone will still be our central tech device by the end of next year; but as augmented reality and wearables progress; we’ll sense more and more that a new paradigm in personal computing is around the corner. That will be helped along by enabling technologies such as 5G networks; which will be stretching far and wide by the end of 2020. And; artificial intelligence will become infused in all kinds of products; allowing gadgets and services to subtly begin to anticipate our wants. These tectonic shifts are already creating opportunity and chances for innovation. Venture capital investments on startup companies are on pace to reach $100 billion in 2018; far exceeding 2017’s $82 billion in investments. The big question is which of these opportunity areas will mature in 2019. We asked venture capitalists; tech analysts; and a few entrepreneurs for their thoughts on the subject. Patrick Moorhead; Principal; Moor Insights & Strategy On the growth of AI: We will see further permutations of artificial intelligence making their way into every aspect of our lives and our devices. We will see more services and experiences. Obviously the upside is that these things will become better at knowing what you want beforehand; and then doing it for you; whether that is meeting management or calling a Waymo self-driving cab or a microwave knowing exactly what you’ve put inside it and then starting when you tell it to start. This is all brought about by massive improvements in computational power and savvy programming. Peter Rojas; Partner; Betaworks Ventures On AI in media: In the coming year; we’ll see a number of technologies that blur the boundaries between what is real and what is synthetic.

Unmasking Bitmasked Dynamic Programming,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write Unmasking Bitmasked Dynamic Programming How to go from Fearing it to Conquering it! Sachin Malhotra · Follow Published in We’ve moved to freeCodeCamp.org/news · 26 min read · Jan 3; 2019 996 5 There are no coincidences in this world. — Grand Master Oogway Well; Master Oogway; no disrespect; coincidences do occur and I think they are just God’s way of remaining anonymous. Not just me; Albert Einstein believes this too 😛. Source: giphy 111; that’s not really my lucky number; so to say. However; this number filled me with joy and ecstasy when I saw it as my rank on the rankings page of the LeetCode contest number 111. What a coincidence! That’s the highest ranking in a weekly contest that I’ve achieved so far on the platform. The contest number and the ranking were obviously pure coincidence. The contest usually consists of an Easy problem; 2 Medium level problems; and a Hard problem. More often than not; the hard problem is something that requires a lot of algorithmic knowledge and prior practice to be able to pull off during the contest. This contest’s final problem was no exception to this. Why do I say it was very hard? Have a look at the number of people who were able to solve it during the contest. As the title of the article suggests; this problem was to be solved using Bit Masking based Dynamic Programming. Dynamic Programming is one of the most dreaded algorithmic domains out there. It requires a lot of practice to develop intuition about a dynamic programming-based solution to a problem. I’ve always considered it to be an enhancement to a recursive solution to a problem. The main idea behind dynamic programming in layperson’s terms is: Avoid repeated computations by caching the results. Bitmasking as a topic in computer programming is something that I have (and I’m sure countless of other developers out there have as well) feared for a long time. This is one of those topics that will surely take you off balance in an interview and get you a rejection. Programmers out there generally tend to avoid practicing problems related to this topic simply because it is difficult to build an intuition about it. Optimizations related to bit manipulations occur in the most unexpected of places. With some practice; I have been able to overcome the fear; so to say; of working on bitmasking-based programming problems. In this article; apart from describing the solution to the problem I’ve mentioned above; in detail; I will also go over some basics of bitmasking and some programming problems where it can come in handy. As with any new thing you learn; it’s very difficult to retain theoretical concepts related to bitmasking. Retention is the best when it comes via practice. That is the main aim of this article. Let’s quickly look at the table of contents before we kick off the main article. Get a bit of Hot Chocolate and be ready for … 0️⃣ 1️⃣ What is Bit Manipulation? 0️⃣ 1️⃣ The Basics ✍️ Counting the Number of set bits Masking and Unmasking a specific bit 🔭 Missing Number 🔭 ☝️🏼✌️🏼 Counting Bits 🖖🏼 🖐🏼 ⛩ Maximum Product of Word Lengths ⛩ Set Representation using Bitmasking 🗄📂Partition Array to K Equal Sum Subsets 📂🗄 🔥 Find the Shortest Superstring 🔥 Conclusion 🍻🍻 References 📝 0️⃣ 1️⃣ What is Bit Manipulation? 0️⃣ 1️⃣ A bit is to the computing world what an atom is to human life. A bit is essentially the smallest unit of storage in a computer. It’s the only unit that a computer understands. The only information that a bit can store is formed from two different states: 0️⃣ and 1️⃣. Any sort of computation that a computer performs is basically some form of bit manipulation. Let’s look at a Wikipedia definition for bit manipulation: Bit manipulation is the act of algorithmically manipulating bits or other pieces of data shorter than a word. Computer programming tasks that require bit manipulation include low-level device control; error detection and correction algorithms; data compression; encryption algorithms; and optimization. For most other tasks; modern programming languages allow the programmer to work directly with abstractions instead of bits that represent those abstractions. Implementation-wise; one of the most useful and effective low-level optimizations to an algorithm is bit manipulation. In some cases; bit manipulation can bypass looping over a data structure and give manifolds speed improvement. The only downfall to such optimizations is the code readability and maintenance. Who wrote this piece of shitty (read lightning fast) code? That is one scary piece of ☠code ☠ The Basics ✍️ At the heart of bit manipulation are the bit-wise operators: And (&) Or (|) Not (~) XOR (^) These are the fundamental operators using which we can perform some complicated bit manipulation operations. Hence; it’s very important to brush up on these operators and their truth tables before moving onto some more interesting stuff. Source: https://www.topcoder.com The truth tables show the results for these operators when they operate on 2 bits represented by A and B. The computer has to deal with much more than just one bit of data. The data processed by the system is generally in bytes or kilobytes or more. How do these operators work on operands represented by for e.g. 8-bits or 16-bits? In such a scenario; the operations are the same; except that they operate on each bit of the arguments. Let’s consider a simple example to clarify this. A = 11101010 B = 00110101 +-+-+-+-  AND  -+-+-+-+ A & B = 00100000 +-+-+-+-  OR   -+-+-+-+ A | B = 11111111 +-+-+-+-  NOT  -+-+-+-+ ~A    = 00010101 +-+-+-+-  XOR  -+-+-+-+ A ^ B = 11011111 In addition to these 4 basic operators; there are two other set of bitwise operators that do come in very handy. Almost all the problems that we will look at in this article will be making use of them to give a huge boost in computational speed. These are the left shift << and the right shift >> operators. Simply speaking; the left shift operator means multiplying a number by 2 and the right shift operator means dividing a number by 2. Let’s look at a simple animation to show why these operators are called left shift and right shift respectively. Left Shift Operation in Action. For demonstrating the left shift operation; we start off with the decimal number 1 and then repeatedly multiply it with 2. As you can see in the binary representation of the resulting numbers; the only 1 in the representation keeps on shifting left one step at a time. That’s why it’s called the left shift operation. Right Shift Operation in Action. Along the same lines; for demonstrating the right shift operation; we start off with the decimal number 128and then repeatedly divide it by 2. As you can see in the binary representation of the resulting numbers; the only 1 in the representation keeps on shifting right one step at a time. That’s why it’s called the right shift operation. Now that we are all versed with the basic binary operators; let’s move on to some simple use cases for these operators. We will look at a few examples below. These are not programming problems by themselves; however; they are used a lot as building blocks in a lot of algorithms. Basic Use Cases 🛠 Counting the Number of set bits One of the basic utilities for the operators we looked at above is to count the number of bits; set in a given binary representation. This might not seem an important use case right now; but we will be getting into more details later on and then it will start to seem more meaningful. For now; let’s just count the number of set bits as efficiently as possible. Source: giphy The first method that we will look at for this; is a bit intuitive. It makes use of the bitwise AND operator. Starting from the least significant bit; we simply check if the bit at each position is set or not and increment a counter accordingly. The AND operator returns True iff both the bits are True. Let’s look at the code for this. Yet another way of doing this is by ANDing the number with itself-1 until the number becomes zero. The number of steps taken to reach 0 will be the number of set bits in the original number. The reason this works is that every time we AND the number with itself-1; one bit gets removed from the number. This goes on until the number becomes zero. Masking and Unmasking a specific bit Suppose we want to mask a specific bit in a binary representation. This simply means turning off the bit or transforming a 1 → 0 . On similar lines; unmasking simply means the reverse operation on a specific bit. You might be wondering why this is useful at all. One of the most important use cases for masking (or unmasking) a bit is in set related operations. We can represent a set of items as an X-bit integer; Xis the number of items in the set. Masking a bit would mean the removal of that item from the set. For a practical application of this; be patient and read on 😛. Source: giphy XOR is a very versatile operator and it is perfect for the task of masking and unmasking operations. 1 ^ ? → 0 0 ^ ? → 1 XOR outputs 1 when both the bits are opposite and a 0 when both the bits are the same. Essentially; we can make use of the same masking variable for achieving the set / un-set operation corresponding to a particular bit (the integer in the ? is being called the masking variable). A ^ (1 << i) The above operation will lead to masking the bit at index i if originally that bit was set in A and the same operation will lead to unmasking the bit at index i if originally it was unset in A. We have already seen how to detect if a bit is set or not when we looked at ways to count the number of set bits in a given binary representation. An important thing to note here is the index. Usually; for data structures in high-level programming languages; whenever we refer to a specific index; we mean the index of a particular element in that data-structure starting from the left end. What we are referring to an index above is from the right end (the least significant bit in the binary representation has the index 0). That’s more than enough of the basics for now. Let’s get to some actual programming problems. This will help solidify what we’ve learned so far in the article and also help build up an intuition for solving problems using bit manipulation in general. 🔭 Missing Number 🔭 Source: LeetCode There are multiple ways of solving this problem. We can sort the given list of numbers and then iterate from 0..n and easily find the missing number. This will give us a O(NlogN) solution. Another way of solving this problem is by making use of a dictionary. We simply add all the elements in our list to a dictionary and then we can simply search for the missing number. This is a linear time solution but it makes use of additional space. Let’s look at how we can achieve a O(1) space; O(N) time solution like a boss 😎 by using bit manipulation. We will make use the XOR property here to solve this problem. As mentioned before; XOR evaluates to True when the input bits are different and it evaluates to False when presented with the same bits. We are interested in the later scenario. What do you think the following evaluates to? A ^ A Source: tenor XORing a number with itself gives us 0. That’s the main idea behind our approach here. So; what we will do is; we will XOR all the numbers in our list. Let’s call the value we get after this as A . We will XOR all the numbers from 0..n together. Let’s call this value; B. By doing this; all the numbers present in the original array will get XORed to their counterparts and will evaluate to 0. The only number left in the end will be the missing number. A ^ B = missing number ☝️🏼✌️🏼 Counting Bits 🖖🏼 🖐🏼 Source: LeetCode This is one of those problems where writing down the answer for various test cases and observing the results for patterns really helps. So; we will do exactly that and use the pattern we find to directly arrive at the final algorithm. Let’s look at the number of 1’s in the binary representation of the first 16 numbers. 0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16 0  1  1  2  1  2  2  3  1  2   2   3   2   3   3   4   1 The pattern being formed above is the following: An even number; E; has the same number of bits as that of E / 2 An odd number; O; has one more bit than that of O / 2 That’s all there is to see in the results above. This is the algorithm in its entirety. All we have to do is to iterate on numbers from 0..n and use the two rules above and we solved the problem like a boss 😎. If you paid attention to the core idea of dynamic programming discussed during the beginning of the article; you’d know that this here; in essence; is a dynamic programming problem. We make use of the result for a previous subproblem (smaller number) to calculate the answer (number of set bits) for the current subproblem. On the face of it; we don’t need any bit manipulation as such to solve this problem. It can be solved by simple if-else clauses and a for loop. So; this is not really a bitmasking + dynamic programming kind of problem. Let’s look at a simple solution based on the ideas above. This is a perfectly good way to solve this problem. For every index; i; we check the number of bits in the number i / 2 and also add 1 if the current number is odd. We can; however; solve it in a geekier way; so to say using bit manipulation. The two operations being performed are: division by 2 and checking if the number is even or not. We have already seen the use of the right shift operator; >>; for division by 2. As for the second operation; we can simply check if the least significant is set or not. If you notice; all the odd numbers have their least significant bit set. While the even numbers don’t. We have already seen how to check if a particular bit is set or not using the AND operator. Let’s see a geekier 🤓 version of the above code. If you look at the runtimes for both the programs; they’re almost the same. A major chunk of the time is consumed by the construction of the output array. Bitwise operations are always optimized and are faster than other higher level programming constructs. ⛩ Maximum Product of Word Lengths ⛩ Source: LeetCode There’s good news and bad news. The good news is that a slightly optimized version of the brute force algorithm will get your code accepted on the platform. The brute force way is to check all the pairs of words and for each pair; check if there are any common characters between them. For all such pairs that don’t have any common characters; record the maximum value of len(word1) * len(word2). The bad news is that this algorithm is extremely slow. Let’s look at the percentage of solutions on LeetCode which this brute force algorithm is able to beat. Source: giphy Shame on you; Sachin! That’s not the kind of stats you want to see for your submission. If you’re someone who simply wants to solve a problem; then your job here is done. Nothing more to do. But; if you’re like me and if you want to make this dog stop 😅; then read on! Let’s look at the time complexity for this brute force algorithm before moving onto a much more optimized solution using bit manipulation. We consider all possible pairs of words from the given array. Considering there are N words in the given array; we will get O(N²) complexity right off the bat. Other than that; we have a dictionary containing sets of characters for each of the words in the dictionary. Considering the size of the alphabet to be 26 (lowercase alphabets only); each set can potentially be of size 26. For each pair of words; we perform a set intersection to check whether the two words have any common characters or not. Set intersection takes linear time and hence; the overall complexity for this algorithm would come out to be O(26N²) which is essentially O(N²). It turns out that we can’t get rid of the part where we have to consider each pair of words from the given array. So; we can’t get rid of the O(N²) part of the algorithm. The portion that we can get rid of; however; is the part where we compare two words and see if they have any common characters. That constant 26 slows down the algorithm a lot. An important thing to note here is that the question simply cares about common characters and not their frequency or their order. What if we simply use a bitmask to represent the characters in a word? What we can do here is to have a bitmask consisting of 26 bits to represents the characters belonging to a particular word. Let’s look at such a representation for a few words to make things clearer. Bitmaps for the three words: hello; algorithm; and tweet. Hope the above figure makes it clear what we mean by a bitmask representing a corresponding word. Once we have these bitmasks for all the words; all that remains now is to check if two words have any common characters or not. If two words would have any common characters; then the corresponding bits for those characters would be set in the bitmasks for both the words. Hence; all we have to do is to do a bitwise AND of the bitmasks representing two words and check if we get a 0 or not. If we do end up getting a 0; that would imply no intersection and that is precisely what we are looking for. For e.g.  Let's consider two words "hello" and "jack"  The bitmask corresponding to "hello" will have the bits for 'h'; 'e'; 'l'; and 'o' set. The bitmask corresponding to "jack" will have the bits for 'j'; 'a'; 'c'; and 'k' set.  Since these words don't have any character in common; the bitwise AND of their bitmasks will give a 0.  Had there been any common characters between them; then both their bitmasks would have set bits at the same indexes (corresponding to the common letters) and hence we would get a non-zero bitwise AND. Let’s look at the code for this modification in the algorithm we just discussed. ord(c) provides the ASCII code for the corresponding character. 122 is for ‘z’ Bitwise operations are super quick. Let’s look at the performance of this algorithm on the LeetCode platform to corroborate the quickness of bit manipulation. Not bad; right? We improved the runtime for our program from 1820 ms earlier to 712 ms now. That’s a huge improvement; isn’t it? It turns out; we can improve this algorithm even further. The improvement can be made because of the fact that two different words can have the same bitmask. For e.g. hello and llohhel both would have the same bitmask. We can store the longest word for a given bitmask since all we care about is maximizing the product of word lengths. Let’s look at the code after incorporating this improvement. By doing this very optimization; the runtime comes down to 208ms 🎉🎉🎉 Source: giphy Set Representation using Bitmasking We introduced an idea in the previous problem which will be crucial in the next two problems that we will discuss. Essentially; we used the idea of bitmasking to represent elements belonging to a set. In the previous article; we considered a set of 26 alphabets and we resented that by using a bitmask containing 26 bits. A 0 at a particular index in the mask would represent set exclusion whereas a 1 would represent set inclusion. This idea is very crucial for dynamic programming problems that deal with subproblems involving a subset of numbers. We can’t really cache a subset of numbers. A set is not a hashable data structure. For e.g. suppose we have an array of numbers [4; 3; 6] Let's look at all possible subsets of this array. [] [4] [3] [6] [4; 3] [4; 6] [3; 6] [4; 3; 6] For dynamic programming problems where intermediate states are defined by these subsets; we need a memory efficient way of performing caching.  What do we do in such a scenario? Don’t worry; there’s a long article ahead of you! This is where we have bitmasks come in. They are memory-efficient ways of representing subsets of elements. Let’s have a look at how we can represent the subsets above using bitmasks. Since we have 3 elements in our given array; [4; 3; 6] we can make use a a 3-bit number for representing each of these elements. An empty subset would be represented by 000. Let's look at each of the subsets along with their bit representations. 000 -->> [] 001 -->> [6] 010 -->> [3] 011 -->> [3; 6] 100 -->> [4] 101 -->> [4; 6] 110 -->> [4; 3] 111 -->> [4; 3; 6] Depending upon the problem’s constraints; we can make use of a bitmask. For e.g. in the previous problem; the alphabet set was limited to the size 26. A lot of programming problems that have small array sizes and involve dynamic programming that require you to hash subsets; usually are an indication of bitmasking-based approach. A 26-bit mask; e.g. in the previous problem; is essentially an integer and we can simply cache that integer in a dictionary. This saves on the memory footprint of the algorithm and greatly cuts down on the time complexity for the algorithm since bit manipulation is very efficient. We can easily include and exclude elements from the subset by masking and unmasking corresponding bits from the mask. Let’s look at another problem based on this idea before we finally discuss the star problem of this article. 🗄📂Partition Array to K Equal Sum Subsets 📂🗄 Source: LeetCode This is just one of those questions that begs you to use bitmasking. Notice the size of the array. It’s just 16 elements. If we consider a bitmask to represent the elements in an array; we’d have a 16-bit integer at our hands. That means; to represent all the possible subsets of a given array; we’d have 2¹⁶ possible integers. We don’t really need actual subsets. All we need is a bitmask telling us the elements belonging to that subset. Based on this idea; let’s look at dynamic programming-based approach to solve the above problem. The problem statement only asks us if a k-equal-sum partitioning is possible or not. It doesn’t ask us to return the actual partitioning. That makes the problem a whole lot simpler. We don’t care which partition an element belongs to as long as the overall sum of a partition is what total_sum / k. As we’ve mentioned in the above paragraphs; we will be using a bitmask to represent the elements of the array. We will use the individual bit states of the mask to identify which numbers have already been assigned a partition and which ones still remain to be assigned one. We can only assign a number to a partition if after adding it to that partition; the total sum remains <= total_sum / k . If the sum; S; of all the elements of the array is divisible by k; we have to complete k — 1 partitions since the last partition will automatically fall into place. In case the total sum is not divisible by k ; then such an equal sum partitioning is not possible. Why dynamic programming? Before looking at the code for this problem based on the ideas we’ve discussed above; it’s important to understand how dynamic programming fits into the picture. We’ve already seen why bitmasking would come in handy. But where exactly does dynamic programming fit in? Recursion is a natural fit for the problem since we have got a set of N elements and we need to partition them into k different subsets all of which have an equal sum. Since we don’t really know what partition a number should belong to; we have to try out all the options. That means; for a given partition; we try adding all available numbers recursively (within the constraints of the partition sum) and see which choice leads us to an answer. The recursion would be based on the following three variables: the number of partitions remaining. the mask representing what elements in the original array are unassigned. and the current partition sum. As we all know; for any problem to be classified as a dynamic programming problem; it should have the following two properties: Optimal sub-structure ~ which simply means that the original problem must be breakable into subproblems and optimal solutions to the subproblems should be usable in a way to find the optimal solution to the main problem. Overlapping subproblems ~ which mean there are multiple recursive calls to the same subproblems and to avoid repeated computations; we can cache the results for our subproblems. Let’s look at the recursion tree for this problem to understand if we have any overlapping subproblems. We already have the first property satisfied. The tuple (K; 12; 3) is the recursion state that gets repeated. K is the number of remaining partitions which in our example is 2. 12 is the current partition’s sum. 3 is the bitmask. If you consider the bitwise representation of 3; you will get 0011. That implies the two elements 5 and 7 from the set [8; 16; 5; 7] and hence the sum 12. In the above recursion tree; we consider K = 2. That means we need 2 partitions each of sum 18. Since we never reach 18 in the tree above; the K never gets reduced. This is just a part of the recursion tree and the complete version. We can clearly see two recursion states getting repeated. We get the same mask 0011 twice. We can simply store the result once and then re-use it later on. Now let’s look at the code for based on bitmasking + dynamic programming. Now we are finally ready to look at the main problem of this article. The problem that is not as straightforward in its bitmasking application as the current one and the previous one. 🔥 Find the Shortest Superstring 🔥 Source: LeetCode What do you think the simplest way of forming a superstring is? You simply take any permutation of the given words and all of these permutations will be valid superstrings. However; the question doesn’t ask us to form any superstring. It asks us to form the shortest superstring covering all the words. For this problem; we will explore the idea of chaining words together. Intuitively; you can consider the idea of chaining as set union. Let’s consider two different set of elements and then look at the combined set containing all their elements together i.e. the union set. The repeated elements are only considered once in the union. As we can see above; whenever we do a union over two sets; the common elements only appear once. We will adopt a similar idea with chaining two words together. Essentially; when chaining words A and B together; we will only consider the common portion between the suffix of A and prefix of B exactly once. Let’s look at the diagrammatic representation for chaining of two words. This is an important concept that will come in handy for solving this problem. So as to avoid repeated computations of finding out the common portion between two words which are being chained together; we will do some preprocessing. We will find out the length of the suffix of A that overlaps with the prefix of B where A and B are being chained together. We will do this for all the pairs of words in our given list. In Python; given a string S; we can make use of S[i:] to obtain all the suffixes and S[:i] to obtain all the prefixes. We make use of this for our preprocessing below. “words” is a list of words that we process. The function “form_edges” is called to compute the common chaining length between all the pairs of words. The function “longest_pref_suf” simply computes this common portion between a given pair of words; A and B. Now that the idea of chaining is clear; we can move onto the next part of the problem where we explain why this problem can be solved recursively. Why Recursion? Now that we are familiar with the concept of chaining; we know that whenever we chain two words together; the new word formed can be shorter than the combined lengths of the two original words. Extending this idea to all the words in the given list; we have to form a superstring that will be formed by chaining one word after the other until we are done with all the words. The important question here is; in what order should the words be chained together? For the three words aabc ; hjaa; and chuj the chaining order hjaa → aabc → chuj = hjaabchuj is better than aabc → hjaa → chuj = aabchjaachuj since the former gives a superstring of length 9 as opposed to 12 in the latter order. So; the chaining order determines the overall length of the formed superstring. We will be trying out all possible arrangements for the superstrings using the given list of words and choosing the shortest one. That seems legit; but why dynamic programming? 🤔 Instead of relying on a recursion tree for explaining the need for dynamic programming; we will look at an example that will explain the same idea. Suppose we are given a set of 5 words [A; B; C; D; E] and we are to form the shortest superstring that contains all the words. We already know that we are solving this problem recursively. Suppose in the middle of our recursion; we are already done deciding the chaining order of the first 3 words. Let’s say this ordering was B → A → C . Now; we need to find out the best way to chain D and E after C so that the overall superstring length is minimized. Let’s say that in our recursion we found that C → E → D was the best chaining order. We don’t know yet if the superstring formed via B → A → C → E → D is the shortest one. However; we know that C → E → D is the best chaining order for the three words C; D; and E . I know it’s gotten tiring; but keep reading 😛 Suppose now we arranged the first three words a little differently in our recursion (a separate recursion path) and now we have A → B → C and we have to recurse again to find out the best possible arrangement for E and D . However; we already know from above the best possible arrangement is C → E → D . Why calculate this again? This is where dynamic programming comes into the picture. That’s it? Go on. Explain some more. Nah; let’s now look at the the Python code bringing all these ideas together. Uh oh! Where the heck is bitmasking in all this? Ok ok; let’s get to bitmasking 🎉 Let’s rephrase the problem in a slightly different manner that will make the requirement for bitmasking very clear. Given a set of N elements; we need to find a suitable arrangement for them that will minimize a certain metric. Since we are relying on dynamic programming; we will be caching results for subproblems. Our subproblems will be represented by the subset of these N items. As we’ve seen in this article and especially in the previous two problems; it’s difficult to cache subsets as it is. In case the problem constraints are small; we can represent the elements of the list using a bitmask and use that for caching purposes. After all; a bitmask is just a number. Let’s finally get to the code for finding the shortest superstring given a set of N words. Line 3 ~ The initial mask is composed of all 1s. That implies all the words are available for chaining. If the mask becomes 0; that means no word is left for chaining. So; the length of the superstring would be 0. This is the base case. Line 7 ~ If you’ve paid attention to the example involving 5 words [A; B; C; D; E] from before; you know that the opportunity of caching arises when we have the two words D and E to be chained together following C. Thus; we need to know the previous word in the superstring so far so as to attach the rest of the words. Hence; prev_i; which represents the index in the original array of the previous word in the superstring is also used for caching purposes apart from the mask. Line 12; 15 ~ We always check all the given set of words and only consider those as options for the current step in our recursion which have not been previously used. We make use of bitmasking for this. To see if a word has been used or not; we simply check if the bit at the corresponding index in the mask is unset or not. Line 18 ~ Makes use of the preprocessing we did earlier. For the word to be chained / attached to the word at index prev_i ; we know the amount of overlap between the two. Thus; if we decide on considering the word at index i as the next word in our recursion; the amount of length it will add to our superstring would be len(A[i]) — overlap between the words A[prev_i] and A[i] All this is fine and dandy; but wasn’t the original question asking for the superstring itself and not just the length of the shortest superstring? Am I shying away from solving the entire problem? Of course not! Source: giphy The function recurse simply returns the length of the shortest superstring and not the superstring itself. The problem statement; however; asks us to find out the shortest superstring. If you look at the code carefully; you’ll notice a parent dictionary. At every step in our recursion; we have multiple options of words which can be chained to the current superstring (thus extending it). We use the parent dictionary to store the word at each step that gave the best answer (shortest length). For a given mask — which tells us which words have already been chained together — and a given previous word (prev_i); the parent dictionary stores the next word that in the superstring that gives the optimal answer. We will use this dictionary to backtrack and form the shortest superstring. In the end; that’s one of the best sights for a competitive programmer; especially if it’s for a hard problem in a timed competition. Conclusion 🍻🍻 Operations on bits are highly efficient and they are generally performed in parallel via optimized system level instructions. It’s difficult; but not impossible; to write clean; understandable code involving bit manipulations. AND ; OR ; and NOT are the three fundamental bitwise operators. The left-shift << and the right-shift >> operators are used for multiplication or division by 2. The XOR operator is a versatile operator that can be used in many different programming problems. It returns True only when both the bits are opposites and False otherwise. Dynamic Programming-based solutions involve some sort of caching for the results of subproblems. The subproblems are represented by a set of variables. These variables are not necessarily primitive data types. Bitmasking comes in very handy in dynamic programming problems when we have to deal with subsets and the list/array size is small. A mask (having all 0s or all 1s) can represent the elements of the set and setting or unsetting a bit can mean inclusion and exclusion from the set. If the array/list/set size is; say; around 20; then you’d have 2²⁰ possible bitmasks which comes out to be almost a million of them. It’s not always the case you will encounter all of these bitmasks in a test case. However; that’s the maximum possible number. We have to be careful about when to use bitmasking. We can’t have a 100-bit mask as that would be computationally intractable. For a solution to be eligible for dynamic programming; it should satisfy the optimal substructure and the overlapping subproblems properties. Usually; through some practice; you can start to identify if the problem at hand will have a DP based solution or not.

A Guide to Angular Security and Authentication with JSON Web Tokens,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write A Guide to Angular Security and Authentication with JSON Web Tokens MESCIUS inc. · Follow Published in MESCIUS inc. · 7 min read · Jan 4; 2019 -- 2 Angular is a great platform for building responsive; universal Single Page Applications. All the stable releases of Angular are production ready and deployed by a large number of enterprises and users everywhere. Here; we’ll shift our focus towards the security aspects of Angular. Web development isn’t about writing code that works; it’s also about writing code that’s foolproof and not prone to vulnerabilities. A number of common vulnerabilities for different web applications are regularly brought to light. Vulnerabilities can seep in through obsolete dependencies; bad coding practices; or irregularities in patching updates. In this article; we’ll discuss vulnerabilities that can occur with Angular application(s) and the best ways to circumvent these vulnerabilities. Regular Angular Updates & Vulnerable Dependencies The Angular team is publishing releases at frequent intervals for different feature developments; bug and vulnerability fixes; security patches; etc. Software development teams are strongly suggested to keep their Angular libraries updated constantly to stay in sync with the latest available developments. If not; malicious users may be able to attack the application that is using known security vulnerabilities associated with older versions of the software. With the sheer number of third-party library components available today; it can be a difficult task to develop applications without the use of these libraries. Libraries sometimes can have publicized vulnerabilities that can be maliciously used by attackers to input harmful data or code into applications. Some of the well-known vulnerabilities include CSRF; buffer overflows; XSS; etc. To verify that your dependencies and components are free some of the common loopholes and exploits; you can use open source vulnerability management tools. Here is a list of things that you can do to ensure that your code is secure. Always download libraries from a repository like npm or GitHub Use updated versions of libraries and avoid obsolete packages Monitor for vulnerabilities by running an npm audit or use a code analysis tool Regularly visit security resources like NVD (National Vulnerability Database) and CVE(Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) Preventing Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) XSS allows malicious users to input client-side scripts into web pages that are accessed by regular users. This code can inflict considerable damage. For example; it’s possible to steal user data or undertake actions that impersonate the user with the intention to cause harm. You can read more about XSS on the OWASP website. Angular Sanitization and Security Contexts In order to systematically and effectively block XSS bugs; Angular assumes each value as an untrusted value by default. Therefore; when a value is entered into the DOM using a template via a property; style; attribute; interpolation or class binding; Angular automatically sanitizes the value and disallows untrusted values. Here is a sample declaration in the BrowserModule: export const BROWSER_SANITIZATION_PROVIDERS: Array<any> = [   {provide: Sanitizer; useExisting: DomSanitizer};   {provide: DomSanitizer; useClass: DomSanitizerImpl}; ]; @NgModule({   providers: [     BROWSER_SANITIZATION_PROVIDERS     ...   ];   exports: [CommonModule; ApplicationModule] }) export class BrowserModule {} The idea behind the DomSanitizer is to sanitize the input and to clean up user-submitted data. Here is an example of the of what the skeleton of the class might look like: export enum SecurityContext { NONE; HTML; STYLE; SCRIPT; URL; RESOURCE_URL } export abstract class DomSanitizer implements Sanitizer {   abstract sanitize(context: SecurityContext; value: SafeValue|string|null): string|null;   abstract bypassSecurityTrustHtml(value: string): SafeHtml;   abstract bypassSecurityTrustStyle(value: string): SafeStyle;   abstract bypassSecurityTrustScript(value: string): SafeScript;   abstract bypassSecurityTrustUrl(value: string): SafeUrl;   abstract bypassSecurityTrustResourceUrl(value: string): SafeResourceUrl; As you would have noticed; there are two distinct patterns. There first is the sanitize method. This identifies the ‘context’ as well as the ‘untrusted value’ and returns a trusted value. The second method uses the ‘bypassSecurityTrustX’ method which captures the ‘untrusted value.’ This is based on value usage and returns the trusted object. The Sanitize() Method In the event that a value is trusted for a particular context; the sanitize method will expose the safe value within it and utilize it directly. If not; the value will eventually be sanitized to be rendered safe based on the security context. Three main functions exist for sanitizing values: The sanitizeHTML function that sanitizes untrusted HTML values by parsing them and verifying its tokens. The sanitizeStlye function that sanitizes untrusted styles or URL values using regular expressions. The sanitizeURL function that sanitizes untrusted URL values using regular expressions. How to Disable Sanitization In certain situations where it might be required to disable sanitization; users are able to work around security using a constructed value via one of bypassSecurityTrustX methods. They can bind this to the value from the relevant template. Here is an example: import {BrowserModule; DomSanitizer} from '@angular/platform-browser' @Component({   selector: 'my-app';   template: `     <div [innerHtml]="html"></div>   `; }) export class App {   constructor(private sanitizer: DomSanitizer) {     this.html = sanitizer.bypassSecurityTrustHtml('<h1>DomSanitizer</h1><script>ourSuperSafeCode()</script>') ;   } } Authentication in Angular using JSON Web Tokens If you’re going to implement authentication in Angular; the best bet is to use a JWT-based authentication system. As a matter of fact; using JSON Web Tokens is the best choice if you’re implementing an authentication system in any Single Page Application (SPA). In a nutshell; JWTs are digitally signed JSON payloads; encoded in a URL-friendly string format. The payload contained in a token defines a user session. This could mean that it contains details unique to the user like userId or emailId. In order to confirm that the token is valid; the server needs to validate the token. What this means is; the server doesn’t have to contact the database to validate the token. The token gets invalidated when it expires; and the expiry time is defined when you create the token. The Angular Authentication Process Outline When the user creates an account; the authentication server creates a new token and returns it to back to the client-side application. The token payload assigns something unique to the user (like a userId) and additional details that include the expiry time. The frontend stores this token somewhere — preferably in a cookie and appends the token into the header for all the requests it make. The server validates the token and if the token is valid; the user is able to access the requested resource. When the token expires; the server decodes and checks whether the payload matches the data in the database. If yes; a new token is generated. For more information specific to Angular; reference this article on Angular-University.io Content Security Policy CSP or Content Security Policy is an additional security layer that assists in detecting and inhibiting specific types of attacks including XSS and data injection. Such attacks have a goal of data theft to the distribution of malware to website defacement. To enable CSP; you would need to configure your web server to return the correct Content-Security-Policy HTTP header. You can find detailed steps to enable CSP on the MDN website. Using the Offline Template Compiler or the AOT Compiler Angular templates are theoretically executable and therefore the HTML tags; binding expressions; and attributes in templates are trusted to be safe. An attacker may be able to perform something malicious if they’re able to parse an unintended value into the template. To prevent such breaches; users can utilize offline template compilers. This process is also known as template injection. In case you use Angular CLI; you can easily enable AOT: ng build --aot ng serve -aot Avoid Direct Use of the DOM APIs Unfortunately; the built-in browser DOM APIs do not automatically secure the application from security vulnerabilities. As an example; ‘document’ — the node that is available through ‘ElementRef’ might contain unsafe methods. Users should avoid interacting with the DOM through direct means and use Angular templates wherever available. XSS Protection on Server-Side The data validation on the client-side is usually for cosmetic purposes. Someone can try to make direct API calls to the backend with the intention of breaking something. All data on the server-side code needs to be validated and should escape appropriately to inhibit server XSS vulnerabilities. This is largely because injecting template code in an Angular application is similar to injecting executable code directly into the application. It is recommended that Angular templates on the server-side not be generated using a template language. HTTP-Level Vulnerabilities Angular comes with built-in support that can help prevent a couple of common HTTP vulnerabilities — Cross-Site Script Inclusion (XSSI) and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF or XSRF). Both of these vulnerabilities have to be inhibited mainly on the server side. However; Angular also assists helpers to make integration on the client side simpler. Cross-Site Script Inclusion (XSSI) XSSI; also known as a JSON vulnerability; enables an attacker’s website to access data using a JSON API. Such attacks work on older browsers by including an API URL via a <script> tag after overriding native JavaScript object constructors. Servers can fend off such attacks by using a prefix on all JSON responses and render them non-executable using the string “)]}’;\n”. The AngularHttpClient library is able to read and strip the string “)]}’;\n” from each response prior to parsing further. Cross-Site Request Forgery (XSRF) XSRF; also known as ‘one-click attack’ or ‘session riding’; is a website violation where unauthorized commands are sent from a web application that is trusted by a user. In usual anti-XSRF methods; application servers transmit a random authentication token via a cookie. The receiving code reads the cookie and includes a custom request header in the token for each following request. The server then makes a comparison between the received cookie value and the request header value and rejects the request in case the values are missing or are a mismatch. The reason this method is effective is because all browsers use the same origin policy. Only the code from the originating website can read the cookies from the site and include custom headers on request. Therefore; only a trusted user application can read the cookie and add a customized header.

Most In-Demand IT Jobs of 2019–2020,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write Most In-Demand IT Jobs of 2019–2020 Skywell Software · Follow Published in DataDrivenInvestor · 5 min read · Jan 3; 2019 658 1 A s a result of digital transformations that many businesses are going through in today’s IT landscape; the jobs that will be in demand will start changing by 2020 and will be more oriented towards more high tech technologies such as AR/VR; AI; and the IoT. The demand for qualified workers to fill these positions is growing as well; which includes commonly found vacancies such as back-end and front-end developer; but there are also some less known ones as well. Let’s take a look at some of the most in-demand IT jobs of 2019–2020. Computer Vision Engineer This is one of the best tech jobs in 2019 because the demand for computer vision engineers has grown at a steady rate over the past five years. Their primary responsibilities include creating and fine-tuning both computer vision and ML algorithms so that they can locate; identify and classify objects. Also; since AR/VR has also grown in popularity and is expected to be a $215 billion-dollar business by 2021; the need for computer vision engineer will also increase because it is directly on Ted with AR and VR. 2. ML Engineer The ML (Machine Learning) engineers create AI systems and machines that are capable of learning and applying what they learned. They conduct advanced programming while working with convoluted datasets and algorithms to train their AI creations. What makes this one of the best technology jobs is that we see pretty much every IT company out there transforming into an AI company; therefore requiring a huge number of investments and making ML engineers a very in demand and popular profession next year and beyond. DDI Editor’s Pick — Machine Learning by Stanford 3. App Developer App developer made our list of top IT jobs because it sits at the crossroads of where technical capacity meets business needs. This role does not simply imply coding. We mentioned the popularity of AR and VR earlier and the demand for AR/VR software developers will also increase. There have been many AR-based games released in 2018 and as well as many other uses of AR and VR and these technologies will be heavily used in 2019. 4. Network Analyst As the IoT becomes mainstream and makes its way into the workplace; there will be a lot more things that will require connectivity in an efficient and easy to use manner; which serves as wind in the sails tech professions such as Network Analyst. They will need to find a way to combine their set of technical skills to produce real-time trending information regarding network traffic and their impact on the company as a whole. Therefore; network analysts will be required to know much more than how sensors work. Future network analysts must possess a thorough grasp of how the entire company operates as well as sound knowledge in AI. These new requirements make this a completely different role than most people are used to. 5. Security Analyst As the number of cyber attacks increases every year and each leak of information is costing companies millions of dollars; one of the jobs trends that is very popular right now and will be in the future; is hiring more and more security analysts. The cyber attacks that we are seeing both in the public and private sector are getting more and more advanced; which means that governments and private companies need to be one step ahead all the time. In 2019; companies will be more proactive in terms of taking on security threats head-on; which means that security analysts will need additional AI and data skills. 6. Business Intelligence Analyst It is helpful to think of the BI analyst as a counterpart to the mobile app developer. The business analyst tackles all of the issues concerning the business side of products; taking into account the company’s need in terms of apps to make a process work. It is the job of the business intelligence analyst to collect all necessary data from a wide variety of sources to draw a comprehensive picture of the company’s positioning in the industry and provide recommendations on how to cut costs and achieve growth. 7. DevOps Lead As you start hiring software developers; testers; and BI analysts; you will need to make sure that you have enough DevOps talent on your team in order to coordinate the work between all of these separate groups. The project management skills that they bring to the table are simply indispensable; which go beyond software development. All companies out there want to organize their operations in the most efficient way possible in order to avoid wasting resources and DevOps is a driving factor in delivering software faster with greater efficiency. 8. Database Administrator As companies provide a greater offering of AI-based software; the demand for database administrators will increase since companies will need to be able to maintain databases in a quality manner to make their products work efficiently. 9. Cloud Engineer An increasing amount of companies are moving their vital systems to the cloud and there are opting for a hybrid approach with many vendors. Cloud engineers will need to come up with scalable solutions and combine both in-house technologies with outside systems. 10. User Support Specialist The technology is becoming increasingly integrated into our daily lives; we will need the help of support specialists more often; which makes this one of the biggest computer jobs in demand. What many people forget is that software development does not end after the release. You still must monitor the performance of the product and provide support to users who are getting adjusted to your product. What jobs will be in demand in 2020? It is difficult to provide a definite list; but we extrapolate the trends that we are seeing on the market today; then the ten jobs mentioned above will definitely be in demand. The jobs of the future in 2020 will be much different from the ones that we are seeing today. Even if the job title will be the same; the job description; skillset; and knowledge needed for performing these jobs will be at the highest level possible. Originally published at skywell.software.

The Mythical 10X Programmer,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write The Mythical 10X Programmer Kyle Coberly · Follow 5 min read · Jan 3; 2019 -- Over 40 years ago; Fred Books published a book called “The Mythical Man-Month.” It was a collection of essays around the thesis that adding resources to a late project makes it later. One of the essays in the book; “The Surgical Team;” describes a way of structuring a team around one super-genius that everyone else helps do their important genius work. It’s a largely insane essay from an ancient era of computing (the ideal “surgical team” has two secretaries and a clerk to input all the code the super-genius wrote on paper onto punch cards). The relevant paragraph from the book: Programming managers have long recognized wide productivity variations between good programmers and poor ones. But the actual measured magnitudes have astounded all of us. In one of their studies; Sackman; Erikson; and Grant were measuring perfor- mances of a group of experienced programmers. Within just this group the ratios between best and worst performances averaged about 10:1 on productivity measurements and an amazing 5:1 on program speed and space measurements! In short the $20;000/year programmer may well be 10 times as productive as the $10;000/year one. The converse may be true; too. The data showed no correlation whatsoever between experience and per- formance. (I doubt if that is universally true.) If you’ve managed programmers at any point after 1975; you may be wondering how on earth you would measure the performance of a programmer in a scientific study. It turns out that in 1968; they: …found that the ratio of initial coding time between the best and worst programmers was about 20 to 1; the ratio of debugging times over 25 to 1; of program size 5 to 1; and of program execution speed about 10 to 1. A few things stand out about this. To create directly comparable results; they used the exact same kind of horseshit Hacker Rank challenges that are near-universally accepted as having little to do with real-world development ability. The study says nothing about maintainability (where code spends most of its life); nor does it measure the kind of skills teams need in the modern era: Communication; adaptability; and collaboration. Lastly; the tools available to develop; debug; and run software (interactive debuggers; automated testing; JIT compilers; etc.) may well have obviated the “10X” advantage a number-cruncher programmer would have had in 1968. Modern software developers are not interchangeable widgets that can be directly measured or compared. You bring your background; your specialties; your domain knowledge; your biases; and all of who you are to real-life software problems; and that’s awesome. So why; 40 years later; does the myth persist? I posit a few reasons: In any given real-life scenario; some developers bring more to the table than others; and some do that often. Measuring that additional value is both impossible and pointless; but plenty of people think that such a way must exist; and that “10X” sounds like a good a way to describe those people as any. In reality; that advantage rarely translates across every stack; domain; etc.; but it’s less impressive to say “I’m a 10X developer on Java backends for FinTech apps as long as I don’t have to do any database stuff; and ‘average developers’ who did it for a few years would be too.” Silicon Valley dev culture breeds the kind of narcissists that think of themselves as 10 times better than an imagined “average” developer (usually represented by some dummy they worked with once). It’s hard to undo 40 years of cowboy neck-beardery in dev culture. The industry is getting a much-needed influx of people from non-traditional backgrounds which is chipping away at the lone-super-genius-doing-everything story we tell ourselves; but it takes a long time. Despite a lot of lip service in recent years; soft skills are still undervalued and algorithmic skills are still overvalued. That’s changing for the better every year; but it’s also going to take a long time. Some people are wrong on the internet. So? This is dangerous for a few reasons. The biggest is that the dopamine and testosterone-infused “I’m better than you at everything” implicit in this 10X myth is hardly welcoming to anyone new to the industry; much less women; people of color; or anyone’s who’s already unsure if they belong. Someone who believes themselves to be a 10Xer is also an instant team liability. Such an inflated sense of worth is hardly conducive to sincere self-reflection; growth; or being willing to make and admit mistakes. Also; who wants to work with some asshole who thinks he or she (although honestly; probably he) is 10 times better than you? “I’m 10 times better than you at everything!” Here’s a thought-experiment: Let’s say you can measure individual productivity. You’re on a team of seven; and everyone contributes “1”; so your team’s output is “7”. Now let’s say one of them is a 10Xer; so if everyone else’s output stays the same and the 10Xer contributes no tech-debt (quite the thought experiment indeed); your output is now “16”. There’s some risk to this though- 10Xers expect 10X money; and are self-described as almost impossibly rare. Someone throws a little more cash at your 10Xer; they leave; and now your team’s output is “6;” with a difficult hunt for a replacement ahead of you. How else might we get to “16"? You’d get a little more than “16” if everyone on the team brought out 15% more out of everyone else (1.15⁶ * 7≈ 16.19). This is the synergy effect. Not only is that far more realistic; it’s also more robust (losing a person knocks you to “12.6"). The upside is huge too- if the 10Xer picks up another X (which; again; is the supposed entire output of another developer); the team’s output goes to “17”- a little less than the gain if the 15% team makes each other 1% better. Teams that consistently produce great results are not comprised of solo super-geniuses who have a bunch of secretaries and clerks doing the unglamorous work while they ponder the good and the true; and I’m not sure that was ever the case. Great teams bring out the best in each other. Keep your surgical teams and 10X myths- 15% is good enough for me.

Spotify’s Plan to Beat Apple: Sign the Rest of the World,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write Member-only story Spotify’s Plan to Beat Apple: Sign the Rest of the World Investors expect the streaming service to replicate its Latin American success in more difficult markets The Financial Times · Follow Published in Financial Times · 9 min read · Jan 4; 2019 512 3 Photo: S3studio/Getty Images By Anna Nicolaou Three years ago Danny Ocean; a cheerful Venezuelan with floppy hair and a silky-smooth voice; moved to Miami to start a new life. He scored a job in a pizza shop; but found himself missing the girlfriend he had left back home. As a Valentine’s gift; he wrote a song in his bedroom for her; wistfully crooning against upbeat synthesisers. He uploaded the song; called “Me Rehúso”; to YouTube and Spotify. It began creeping up Spotify’s viral charts in Colombia; Chile and Peru; which caught the attention of Spotify’s curators — the employees who monitor minute-by-minute listening data. They unanimously agreed to add it to their playlists; such as “Verano Forever”; where Spotify’s users lapped it up. Week by week; Spotify added it to more playlists; each with bigger followings; until two months later the song made it to the holy grail — “¡Viva Latino!” — which has the clout to catapult unknown acts into stardom. In less than a year and with only one released song; Mr Ocean attracted a bidding war among the world’s largest music labels; before he signed a plum recording contract with Warner Music. The lanky 26-year-old skateboarder was soon labelled the new king of reggaeton; the popular genre that combines Latin music and hip-hop. Internet fairy tales like this have circulated for some time. Justin Bieber was discovered on YouTube a full decade ago. But in a business now dominated by online streaming; Latin America is having a moment. In 2017; music revenue increased in the region faster than in any other; as a young; internet-savvy population streamed music in the billions; prompting Rolling Stone to declare the year Latin’s “pop takeover”. Apart from the Danny Oceans of the world; few could be happier about the synergy between music streaming and Latin America than Spotify — whose stock price; and arguably future; depend on repeating the same trick in new markets. Spotify needs to keep adding subscribers to make Wall Street happy as it battles Apple; one of the richest companies in the world… Create an account to read the full story.

Logic Theory — Truth Tables,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write Member-only story Logic Theory — Truth Tables Part III — Intro to the Interdisciplinary Logic Tool Jesus Najera · Follow Published in Towards Data Science · 5 min read · Jan 3; 2019 254 1 Originally Published On https://www.setzeus.com/ Now equipped with the principles of logic theory as well as basic notation; it’s time to explore the concept of equivalency in logic. Specifically; what makes two compound premises equal? Two compound premises X & Y are logically equivalent if; for each assignment of truth values to the primitive premises which make up X & Y; the statements X & Y have identical truth values. That’s a tricky definition to swallow; but it’s the application of this definition that we care about learning. In order to achieve this; we’ll walk through multiple; increasingly-complicated examples. First though; let’s take a detour to learn a bit more about our Excalibur for this journey — one of the most simple; yet powerful tools for logicians to prove logical equivalence: truth tables. Introduction to Truth Tables A truth table is a visual tool; in the form of a diagram with rows & columns; that shows the truth or falsity of a compound premise. It’s a way of organizing information to list out all possible scenarios from the provided premises. Let’s start with the most simple example; a truth table depicting a single premise manipulation: a negation (~) of a primitive premise (P) Originally Published On https://www.setzeus.com/ Truth tables are always read left to right; with a primitive premise at the first column. In the example above; our primitive premise (P) is in the first column; while the resultant premise (~P); post-negation; makes up column two. It’s easy to overthink things here — don’t forget that a premise is simply a statement that is either true or false. Since this example only has a single premise; we only need to track for two outcomes; resulting in two rows for when P is true or when it’s false. Row one describes; reading left to right; that if P is true; then the negation of P is false; row two displays that if P is already false; then the negation of P is true. Let’s move on to a more complicated example of truth tables in the wild by inserting a connective we’ve previously seen… Create an account to read the full story.

A 3 step guide to assess any business use-case of AI,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write A 3 step guide to assess any business use-case of AI Uday Marepalli · Follow Published in The Startup · 9 min read · Jan 3; 2019 -- 2 Image Credits: Greg Rakozy (Unsplash) If anyone asks me what I learnt by starting off my career working in a venture capital firm; my first reply would be to mention that it was the unique pleasure of being a generalist in a world that expects recent college graduates to work on specific areas. On deeper thought; it is the only industry which gives you a chance to evaluate ideas and trends. I refer to it as ‘opportunity spotting’. Or a perch to look at what the future holds. When every entrepreneur you meet and every report you study speaks about AI; you tend to keep a close tab on it. When I moved to a venture backed AI computing startup (Series C); it was this skillset of opportunity spotting that I took along. Performing a deep dive on multiple industries; identifying use-cases of AI adoption and figuring out market entry points was an extension of what I learnt in VC. I lost no time in applying the same principles and mental frameworks. But I couldn’t have been more wrong. At Columbia; I took quantitative courses centered around ML to get a feel of the implementation part of adopting AI solutions. It was my first exposure to Python; a language which The Economist has referred to as the world’s most popular coding language and the lingua franca of most people working in AI/ data science. In the past 12 months Americans have searched for Python on Google more often than for Kim Kardashian; a reality-TV star. A commonly used phrase (cliche?) by managers is to take a ‘30;000 ft. view’ towards building a business. As a young professional interested in technology businesses; I was so caught up in trying to hone that skill that I didn’t realize that my interest area required a different approach. However; getting hands-on with the execution side of ML via coursework; couple of MOOCs’; projects involving client delivery and a lot of reading has led me to the conclusion that the traditional way of evaluating opportunities in the AI space is incomplete at best and rudimentary at worst. Here’s a 3 step framework that I now use. Understand All Things Data “Without data; you’re just another person with an opinion.” W. Edwards Deming has been described as the national folk hero of Japan for reviving its industry after World War II. His introduction contains a lot of adjectives but going by his above quote; we must add ‘prescient’ to that. A course work project involving logistic regression and decision trees took a team of 3 around 20+ hours to group publicly available data across years; figure out what we could actually do with the dataset collected; understand factors that could help us predict the output and decide on the combination of factors that we were going to use. It probably took us around 20% of that time to build the model and draw conclusions. Over the last quarter of 2018; our project team has consulted with a global market-intelligence firm and a NASDAQ listed ad-tech company. We are using deep learning/data analytics to solve business process challenges. For an automatic keyword extraction project with multiple types of articles; our ideal approach would have been to draw from deep key phrase extraction research being done by pioneers in the NLP world. But when we received data from our client; we realized that the annotated data would not suffice to build a traditional deep learning based model. We are now back to the table to research on statistical methods/manual annotations to work through it. To really understand what it takes to build AI/ML powered solutions; you need to work with your first dataset. Either for a course project or a deployment ready solution; major tasks of AI require practitioners to train algorithms with vast amounts of data. It takes disproportionate time to collect; clean and organize such data when compared to working on algorithms. Many industry professionals are voicing the opinion that it is actually datasets and not algorithms that drive breakthroughs. Looking at solutions being implemented in the industry from a competitive analysis perspective without thinking through what datasets gave a certain company a competitive advantage; what partnerships opened up access and an estimation of the underlying approach might just prove to be redundant when your team works on putting a roadmap in place. If you are on the business side; any tangible recommendation slide should have a section detailing what the organization’s approach towards obtaining/handling data should be. Track the State of the Art As a recovering VC industry professional; I still love the concept of a business moat (and the word keeps cropping up in my blog too!). When I had to research on AI adoption across industries; my first move was to understand how companies across the world were using AI today. But then; you can’t see what is most in vogue today and put your eggs in that basket. You need to have an inkling of what tomorrow brings. To account for this; we tracked sub-areas where there were growing VC investments. However; in hindsight; this might not have been a complete solution. This was my traditional ‘opportunity spotting’ tendency kicking into full force. Once you take a peek at the implementation part of it; you realize the dizzying pace of research and wide set of solutions that exist to solve business needs. Take the case of image recognition for example. Cloud hosted AI/ML platforms of the kind of Google Vision/ Amazon Rekognition/Clarifai have made it easier for face recognition; detecting objects; text detection; logos/landmark detection. Then there are other solutions like OpenCV which bundle a host of algorithms for the same. These plug and play kind of platforms have largely reduced the need for firm to hire vision engineers for low-hanging use cases. But globally; computer vision is a hot space with billions of dollars of venture money flowing into this area with the Chinese startup SenseTime alone raising $1.2 billion. Different business use-cases require algorithms with varying levels of sophistication. Different levels of sophistication motivates companies to push the barriers of what was previously possible. There is no single number than can capture the size of the opportunity just like there is no single one algorithm-fits all approach. There’s another point here. Annual business review meetings have a 3–5 year strategic plan. But several factors have contributed to an explosion of AI research and we see a changing definition of state of the art; sometimes in as short intervals as a year. Sample this. Let us take a look at underlying infrastructure to look at the ‘velocity’ of progress. In a year and a half; the time required to train a network to classify images from the famous ImageNet corpus has fallen from one hour to about 4 minutes. The AI index report mentions that this has been possible due to both algorithmic innovation and better infrastructure. Now; imagine the cascading impact on other areas across training and inference at the cloud or at the edge due to these advancements. Side Note: Recommend reading the AI Index report (2018). It is authored by professionals/ subject matter experts from Open AI and a host of other universities led by Stanford and is an authoritative text summarizing key happenings.So; the idea of a business moat is not long term in nature but a temporary advantage as the times they are a-changin. From a strategy perspective; it is important to think of ways to sustain it and this usually comes from progress on the quantitative side (combining hardware-software engineering/ data science etc. here). This brings me to the final step. Talk to a Quant Colleague “Content without method leads to fantasy; method without content to empty sophistry.” I was interviewing for a Product Internship role (Machine Learning focus) at a major real-estate tech company (B2C) when I had the opportunity to ask my interviewer a question towards the end. “How do you incorporate/evaluate product ideas your data science team comes up with in your roadmap?” “Oh! That tends to happen a lot. We usually…………… .” It is natural to assume that product vision is set by the business team. In industries like semiconductors etc. where product roadmap is set in stone; this might be true. But when it comes to AI; this logic is flawed. In fast-changing fields; the quantitative guys are at the forefront of innovation. At a 30;000 ft view (can’t resist!); most of the current advancements we are seeing in cutting edge research around deep learning/ vision have been initiated by one researcher’s untiring efforts. Jeff Dean from Google; John Giannandrea from Apple; Ilya Sutskever from Open AI; Yann Le Cunn from Facebook have all been part of multiple business units commercializing products worth $billions and none of them have taken a business school course ever. The line between engineering and business professionals will be a blurred one in any AI related application. The researchers at the AI computing firm had unique insights on what differentiated a particular algorithm for a particular use case. At the executive level; it was the Software Head who took a keen interest in understanding if there was a primary use-case/product fit. This point of seeking out advice from quantitative team members was drilled into me when working on projects at Columbia. A call with a data scientist from the market intelligence firm gave us more insights than 3 meetings with the business analyst responsible for project delivery. We were focusing on accuracy of the classification instead of improving our recall value. It is a ratio change when you are on the business side but an whole change in approach for the data scientist on our team. 30;000 ft. views (one last time!) usually looks at business strategies from the top. Equivalent to the train-test considerations (bias/ variance); my experience has been that the unless you involve your data scientists/ engineers in Strategy sessions; there is every chance that you might be on the receiving end of untoward surprises during the implementation phase. That’s probably why most companies are locked in a talent war to hire AI talent. The opportunity cost of not doing so is a real business threat. “We have had difficulty filling jobs for a number of years. It does slow things down.” As I delve deeper into topics around AI/ML that would help me better communicate with engineering/data science teams; I see a lot of ads related to picking up AI/ML skills on my social media feeds. They mostly follow a template indicating a statistic related to AI adoption by businesses and a course that will help you pick up concepts. The duration varies from anywhere between 6 days to 6 months depending on usually two sets of target audience — business professionals in case of the former and college students for the latter. I am not sure if a 6 day course has enough of depth to cover the basic difference between classification and clustering algorithms or explain what constitutes statistics vs ML vs AI. However; if you are a business professional fascinated by this space; I think there is a better way to understand the true implications of it. One that will aid you better in building strategy. Try finding a dataset in the area you work in and use one of the zillion tutorials available online to build a rudimentary model after thinking through what you want to achieve. Now check the progress in that particular and think about how your solution can maintain a sustained lead over that of your competitor’s. Think ‘velocity’ over ‘speed’. And in case you are stuck or need to validate your thoughts; just request a data-scientist/ AI engineer in your company for a coffee meeting. :) I am currently pursuing a Master’s in Management Science at Columbia University; New York. My prior work experience includes a generalist role reporting to the CEO of a venture backed AI Hardware startup; a stint in VC and a failed attempt at entrepreneurship!

Snap’s Chief Evan Spiegel: Taming Tech and Fighting with Facebook,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write Member-only story Snap’s Chief Evan Spiegel: Taming Tech and Fighting with Facebook America’s youngest billionaire on Snapchat’s future and why he limits his kids’ screen time The Financial Times · Follow Published in Financial Times · 10 min read · Jan 3; 2019 -- 2 Photo: Stephanie Keith/Getty Images By Tim Bradshaw It only takes about 30 seconds of waiting in line at Nando’s before somebody recognises Evan Spiegel. “You’re not from Snapchat; are you?” a young man asks. “You are! Oh! Good to see you.” Spiegel has got better at dealing with these encounters. Though he described himself this year as shy; the 28-year-old stands out today with his sharp dark suit; white open-collar shirt and certain kind of LA sheen. He immediately introduces me; as if the guy would care at all who I am; and asks what he is up to. Spiegel may not be quite as famous as Mark Zuckerberg — nobody has so far made a semi-fictionalised movie about him — or the founders of Google. But as America’s youngest billionaire and co-founder of Snapchat; the picture-messaging app used by 186m people every day; this is the kind of thing that tends to happen when you’re hanging around in a chicken-and-chips joint. During the course of 2018; Wall Street has fallen out of love with Spiegel. Shares in Snapchat’s parent company Snap are ending the year almost 75 per cent below their peak in February. But the paradox of Snapchat has long been that even if grown-ups write it off; the kids still flock to it. The same seems to be true of its creator. Our new friend; a DJ manager; is so star-struck that he doesn’t know what to do when called forward to the counter to order. Stay and seize this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to pitch to the Snap chief executive? Or hurry forward for some peri-peri chicken with macho peas and unlimited drink refills? Spiegel is polite and friendly; suggesting that the DJ manager send over some of his artists’ tracks. He isn’t fazed by calling out his email address in the middle of a Friday lunch crowd. The DJ manager doesn’t think to ask why Spiegel; who flew in to London for a few hours on his private jet to speak at a media conference; is stopping off at a Nando’s on the south side of the Thames. There are so many people waiting for a table that I worry we will have to conduct our interview… -- 2 Written by The Financial Times 24K Followers · Editor for  Financial Times Follow,['Snap’s Chief Evan Spiegel: Taming Tech and Fighting with Facebook'],The Financial Times,https://medium.com/@Financial_Times?source=post_page-----c714b8c54984--------------------------------,10 min read,Jan 3  2019,https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1000/1*Ypyx1-iN6BLfP5yRWB8Ykw.jpeg
The failure of Wechat in India & a new breed of Chinese entrepreneurs,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write The failure of Wechat in India & a new breed of Chinese entrepreneurs Dinesh · Follow 6 min read · Jan 3; 2019 -- 1 Factordaily did a story about how Wechat failed in India. It’s quite well written & parts of the story are contributed by my friend & former colleague Himanshu Gupta. If you haven’t read it; you can check it out here — https://factordaily.com/how-wechat-faded-into-the-silence-in-india/. As someone who’s followed the evolution of chat apps & used most of them extensively; i thought i’ll offer my thoughts on the subject. A key argument in the blog is that Wechat failed to localize it’s product for the Indian market. In my view while localization plays a part in success of a platform; the bigger ideology behind the product & deeper market conditions usually lead to the success or failure of a particular product. Here by localization i mean adding/removing/modifying features or translating app text/content(Example local music in Tik-tok) or changing notation/icons(clap instead of like) not re-thinking the product for the native market & designing from ground up met to their needs specifically. When launching a new product in an existing market; the most important factor is differentiation. One simply can’t compete with the same features for the same set of users. There are 2 approaches to launching a product — launch on a smaller scale; understand the key needs & iterate(something Newsdog is also doing with multiple apps) or (if $$$ permitting) do a big bang launch to generate curiosity among your users & try to make users jump ship. Wechat when they launched in India focused on Voice notes — a feature used in China to a great extent to differentiate & the social aspect of the app. WeChat TVC — focus on voice notes The TV campaign got them a initial set of users but maybe in the end the users didn’t use the features highlighted. The set of users who used the app was still English speakers who preferred text messaging to voice notes. Then in Nov 13; they tried the ‘all-in-one social app’ messaging. WeChat TVC — ‘all in one social app’ branding To understand why Whatsapp won where Wechat struggled one has to consider the history of the two products. Whatsapp is primarily a chat app; it helps you communicate with one another. Quickly. Wechat on the other hand was already a social network & chat system in China before coming to India. When Wechat launched in India; India already had a strong Facebook presence where we ‘added our friends’; we didn’t need another social network. And as Himanshu points out ‘’built for richer media interactions such as stickers; voice messages and video calling’ it’s product didn’t work on lower end devices in India. On the other hand Whatsapp took a different route. They had a simple philosophy — make communication seamless for everyone. This meant their biggest design principle was simplicity. They didn’t add unnecessary features keeping the product simple to use for everyone. And more importantly since the founders of Whatsapp were tech guys — they focused on improving the tech infrastructure so that it worked on various network conditions & low memory devices. At a time when SMS charges were exhorbitant; Whatsapp with it’s free messaging was just what users in India wanted. Whatsapp spread like wildfire. If you want to read more about Whatsapp’s design philosophy; check this blog post by Charlie Deets — https://medium.com/facebook-design/one-year-designing-at-whatsapp-c20b4c46bae6 Also Whatsapp worked on all phones from the very beginning — Nokia; Windows; Android; iOS — all of them; thus making sure you could communicate with all of your friends regardless of the device they used. Quite simply; Whatsapp was the better messaging product & all Indians cared about was messaging. Not finding users to chat with nearby or chatting with random strangers using shake. The other important player in the market decided to target younger users. Hike did a whole bunch of innovations to start with. Private chat mode; Indian stickers & ‘hide last seen’ — all directly attacked Whatsapp & were essential in getting a young user-base to shift to Hike. It’s referral program for free recharge helped it get more users in the short term. However in the end; the network effects of Whatsapp were just too powerful for Hike to survive & with the messaging application battle lost Hike increasing looked to evolve it’s app around the payments & social. Hike tried in vain with multiple TV advertising campaigns & another recharge program in a bid to boost falling usage but i suppose in the end it was too uphill a battle. In hindsight one can say Hike spread it’s bets too far & lost focus but had it worked we’ll just say they kept experimenting to win. Hike Stickers — so much fun! Over time Whatsapp integrated more deeply into the users lives. We made groups to keep up with each other; we shared news & content with one another. We used Whatsapp to share photos. And to share location. And smaller businesses sent files using the app. Slowly work communication moved to Whatsapp since it was just faster & simpler than using email. Also since everyone was hooked onto Whatsapp; the replies were faster when you pinged here. So more people pinged on Whatsapp. People changed their DP to broadcast a new place they had been to or to just profess their love for selfies. Parents spied on their kids using ‘last seen’. And insecure couples fought over it. Then came the blue ticks & that took the whole game to a newer level. As Himanshu points out quite accurately; since WeChat was fighting a competitive battle with China at the time; it was less keen to invest in product changes in India. This has been the case typically with large social companies whose revenue comes to a great extent from their home markets. Facebook isn’t very keen to customize features for India nor is Snapchat keen to improve it’s tech for emerging markets. Only recently with Jio have multiple players woken up to the India opportunity with Google building a special Next Billion Users team to build applications specifically for India. In April 2014; Facebook started forcing users to download the messenger app to continue to chat with their friends. A master move as part of a broader unbundling effort; it led to a swift rise in the usage of messenger. A big reason for the move was Facebook recognizing that messaging was a much more sticky and frequent use-case than social networking. Having said all this; in my opinion WeChat gave up too early. If we follow the timeline; Tencent had the financial might & engineering capability to make it big difference & there was always the possibility of Whatsapp losing it’s way in the middle like Uber. Consider the music streaming market — Gaana has persisted over the years with multiple TV campaigns & product iterations to emerge as the leading player right now. A new brand of Chinese entrepreneurs Utility apps like Shareit; CleanMaster & multiple photo editors have had success in international markets for a long time. But before Bytedance did it with Tik-Tok & Bigo went big in South East Asia; taking an app built in China & expanding it across the world wasn’t something one imagined possible especially in content & social media space. Zhang Yiming’s success will inspire a newer age of Chinese entrepreneurs to dream big & explore international markets. It’s already happening with 44 of top 100 apps on the Indian playstore in 2018 being Chinese. So what’s changed from 2012 to now? The Chinese have gotten better at understanding the Indian market & executing on their plans. Tik-tok has tied up with Avneet Kaur; Jannat Zubair(plays Pankti in Tu Aashiqui Hai)- young faces of Indian television it’s audience identifies with to promote their product & people who have a higher engagement with their users than a Katrina Kaif/Parineeti Chopra. Vigo-video has video content partnerships with Elvish Yadav & MakejokeOf — both immensely popular channels from Haryana & Kanpur respectively. They’ve opened up offices in India to engage with creators & support them. When they merged Musically with Tik-tok; they got all creators to publish a video explaining the new brand to quell the expected backlash. In short; they’re just executing better. WeChat lost because it only committed partly to winning the Indian market but the newer age of Chinese entrepreneurs are in it to win it. That’s it for now.

Get Ready for These Rocket Milestones in 2019,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write Member-only story Get Ready for These Rocket Milestones in 2019 From moon missions to crewed launches; it’s going to be an eventful year for space exploration. Strap yourself in. MIT Technology Review · Follow Published in MIT Technology Review · 7 min read · Jan 3; 2019 -- 1 Photo: SpaceX/Flickr/public domain By Erin Winick 2018 ended with a slew of rocket launches. That momentum is carrying into 2019. This year will see a series of milestones from all around the world. While a lot of focus will be on SpaceX and Boeing preparing to launch astronauts from US soil once again; other countries; like China; India; and Israel; have also got some momentous launches planned. Here are the ones we will definitely be watching closely (very likely on our second monitor at work). All dates subject to change based on launch delays and adjustments. SpaceX’s First Demo Launch of Its Crew Vehicle January 17; 2019 Rocket: SpaceX Falcon 9 Photo: SpaceX/Flickr/public domain It’s somehow fitting that this landmark launch will take place at Launch Pad 39A at the Kennedy Space Center (best known as the pad from which Apollo and shuttle missions also departed). The launch will send up a human-free version of the SpaceX Dragon capsule that will eventually contain astronauts. It will be the first in a series of tests NASA requires before it will put people on board SpaceX’s rockets. The launch’s success is crucial if the firm is to stick to its goal of launching the first astronauts into orbit from US soil since the end of the shuttle program. If all goes to plan; it’ll also lessen the US’s dependence on Russia for getting astronauts to the International Space Station. Originally scheduled for January 7; it was moved 10 days to avoid any traffic jams at the space station; but there is a chance the government shutdown could now cause additional delays.

Give Web Developers a Code Editor and a Trumpet; What Happens?,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write Give Web Developers a Code Editor and a Trumpet; What Happens? Not What I Expected: My Web-Midi Demo in This Year’s Chrome Dev Summit Uri Shaked · Follow 8 min read · Jan 3; 2019 -- 1 It all began when I failed to build a Trumpet Playing Robot in Geekcon. Shortly after; I was invited to present a demo at the Chrome Dev Summit; and thought this would be a great opportunity to explore a new API I always wanted to play with (literally) — Web MIDI. The result was not quite what I was expecting; as you will shortly discover. MIDI Keyboard and a light bulb?! Read on to find out Last year; I presented the In-Real-Life Chrome T-Rex Game in the same event. It was a fun experience; and I learnt a whole bunch of new skills. It was; however; a huge undertaking for me — I spent a month of my life trying to make that happen; and fixed issues with the hardware and bugs in the software up to the very last moment; in the hotel room the night before the conference. I didn’t want to repeat the same experience this year; so I tried to go with a less demanding project this time. After spending some more time tinkering with the trumpet and even creating an JavaScript and Angular powered device that would measure the air pressure; I realized I was heading exactly to the same direction as the last year — much work; high risk; very demanding project. So I sent the conference organizers an email: This Is Not Going To Work! After explaining the situation in short; I presented them with two options: An hour later; Robert Nyman replied: So my goal was set to provide the “Best Experience”. Challenge Accepted! I spent the next few weeks building the electronics for the trumpet; designing a 3D-printed finger mechanism for it; and even coming up with a Web-Audio based sound engine for it. The project still consumed much of my time; but it also provided me with a bunch of post topics for my daily blogging challenge. Fast forward to the days before the conference. It was just after AngularConnect; and I was travelling in the airplane to the bay area. At that time; I had all the electronics for the project ready and packed inside my luggage; but there was one missing piece — There Was No User Interface I spent so much time getting the hardware to work that I totally neglected the user interface part. I only had a simple web page that provided a piano-like interface: Even wondered how to create a piano keyboard in HTML? Check out the source code This was obviously not the “Best Experience” for the Chrome Dev Summit attendees. As I had WiFi in the plane; I decided to spend my 10 hours flight working on that. I started by asking myself: what would be the best user interface for the summit attendees — developers? The Best User-Interface for Developers; Code Editor The goal of the project was to educate developers about the Web MIDI API; so it made a lot of sense to show them the JavaScript code that powered the demo. But then I thought — why only see the code? Code editors are where most developers feel at home. I decided this would be the user interface for my demo; so the attendees will not only see the code behind it; but will also be able to tinker with it and save their modified versions. Then; by the end of the conference; I will have a gallery of user-contributed code snippets that play different tunes. Or so I thought… I spent the first few hours of the flight researching different solutions. After comparing several alternatives (such as codemirror; which I also used for tsquery-playground); I decided to go with Monaco Editor; which is the editor from Visual Studio Code. It provides code auto completion and types checking (thanks to tight integration with TypeScript); which is essential when exploring a new API. Exploring new APIs is a breeze with auto complete You can try it yourself by using the simulator version. This is a special version that simulates the Web MIDI API; so I could test the code while without a real MIDI instrument connected to my computer (obviously; playing a real trumpet while in the plane wouldn’t be practical. Or would it? 😉). A couple of hours later; the project was more or less ready; and I landed in San Francisco. It was probably the most productive flight I had so far; and surprisingly I managed to squeeze nearly 1GB of data out of the plane’s WiFi (400MB of which consumed just by npm). You can find the complete source code for this project on GitHub; including some tricks I employed to visualize the code execution (more on that in a future post). When I got to the hotel; I quickly unpacked and started assembling the project in my hotel room: Setting up in the hotel room: 2 artificial fingers ready; one more to go! A quick dry-run revealed that despite the long journey; everything was still functional; and worked well with the editor I hacked together during the flight. Ready for the prime time! The Conference Day Finally; the big day has arrived! I was really curious to see whether the attendees will take on the opportunity to write some code for my demo. So I arrived early at the conference venue to set everything up: Debugging is always more effective with your eyes closed Despite having worked perfectly in the hotel; there were some issues with the getting the Raspberry Pi connected to the conference’s WiFi; but thanks to the very helpful event organizers; an Ethernet cable was provided and an hour later everything was ready. Then; came the first surprise: A MIDI Keyboard My friend Lars Knudsen also attended the conference; and as he knew about my project; he decided to surprise me and brought a MIDI keyboard 🎹. Then came the brilliant idea of creating a JavaScript code snippet that would connect the keyboard with the trumpet — You play the keyboard; get the sound out of the trumpet: Lines 9–10 are where the magic happens and the result: Ken Franquiero playing Doom E1M1 on the trumpet using with Midi Keyboard 🎶 MIDI All Things! But it didn’t stop there. He also “happened” to have a MIDI Saxophone (I didn’t even know such thing exists); so he connected it too; and now he could play the Saxophone and get the sound out of the trumpet: Just when I thought I have seen it all; Ruth John suddenly appeared with a mysterious MIDI device and plugged it into the demo: Ruth trying to figure out how to connect her MIDI device to the demo A few minutes later; her device was controlling the trumpet; too: That was definitely an unexpected twist in a plot! But what happened with my original hypothesis? Did people actually write code to play songs? Developers with Code Editor and Trumpet 👩‍💻🎺 When I wrote the “Web MIDI Playground”; the code editor for my demo; I included a sample code snippet that plays a few notes; so others could use it as a starting point. Lars took the opportunity to code “Hava Nagila”; which you can listen to in the online simulator. Next; Shmuela Jacobs coded some song her baby loves listening to: Pair programming is always more fun! 🎶 She hit “Run!” and started moving to the tune: This was the first program she wrote especially for her baby! Check out the code She also told me that it was her first time writing code with async / await; and she really liked how straight forward it was. The other attendees played her code snippet more than 50 times throughout the event! So yeah; people were actually writing code to play some music during the conference. What I didn’t anticipate was… Developers Love Abstractions Markus was a Swiss guy I met in Espruino forums after sharing the experience of bringing back a fried Espruino board from the dead. After he learned about my project; he volunteered to help with manning the booth during the event. He arrived shortly after we connected the MIDI keyboard to the project: Somehow an “Edge” sticker made it to the electronics box of the project As you would expect from a seasoned developer; he immediately recognized the opportunity to create an abstraction layer; and spent the next two hours working on this piece of code; creating an interpreter for some text-based music notation format he came up with: Markus‘s musical notation format: Note name and octave; followed by duration and lyrics Markus also included the lyrics (as you can see above); and interpreter displays them on screen as the song is playing; turning the project into a trumpet-karaoke machine: The next surprise was the brainchild of Reilly Grant; a software engineer on the Chrome team. We met in the summit a year before; and this year he also volunteered to help manning the demo booth. After observing many attendees play melodies using the MIDI keyboard; he came up with a brilliant idea: Abstracting Away The Code Editor He spent about an half an hour writing a “Composer” snippet; that would record whatever you played on the keyboard; and would spit out code that plays the same thing. You could then copy this code and save it in your own snippet. My original intention was to have the attendees write code to play the trumpet; but thanks to Lars’es keyboard and Reilly’s piece of code; they now had an interface where they could create the code without actually writing it. It was all abstracted away! This resulted in a bunch of new code snippets that were recorded by the attendees; such as the following: But the fun didn’t end here. Reilly; who remember my magical battery powered smart light bulb from the previous year; asked me if I had it with me. Luckily; I did; so we proceeded to combine the Web MIDI code together with Web Bluetooth: Let There Be… Light! We wrote a short piece of code that uses Web Bluetooth to connect to the bulb and light it whenever you played a note. About 15 minutes later; he had this working: Web MIDI and Web Bluetooth working together! So now you could also make a disco light show while playing the trumpet with keyboard! Developers Are Full of Surprises When I started working on this project; I didn’t really know what to expect. Projects presented at conferences are usually watch-only or have limited ways you can interact with them (like the T-Rex game last year). This time; I gave the attendees the full power of a code editor; and I wasn’t sure where they will take it. I was really blown away by all of different ways the attendees programmed my robot and connected it to all sort of other MIDI devices; as well as created interesting abstractions on top of the code editor.

Do Companies Actually Need Blockchain?,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write Do Companies Actually Need Blockchain? Iliya Zaki · Follow Published in HackerNoon.com · 7 min read · Jan 3; 2019 101 Blockchain Technology is the talk of the town these days and integrating the tech into your business can be advantageous. However; enterprises should weigh their options wisely. The technology can drastically help reduce cost; increase revenue and eliminate the need of a middle-man. But as it is still relatively new and untested; blockchain’s benefits come at the expense of speed of transaction. For now.. 😉 Let us take a look at several conditions that can help you decide whether blockchain technology is truly needed in your business. Are you ready for the Future? Do you guarantee Data-Security? Everyone is a Tech-Company! One way to find out if Blockchain is suitable for your business is to evaluate your firm needs. Another way is to evaluate to opportunities Blockchain opens up on efficiency and security improvements; alternative financing for new business units or expansion. The hype; speculative new assets such as Cryptocurrencies and alternative fundraising means like ICOs; surrounding ‘Blockchain’ has exaggerated the realistic capabilities and applications of this new technology. Businesses; developers; and investors have yet to identify the right applications that are appropriate for distributed ledger technology. Databases Databases have been used for decades to persist state and query data. Decades worth of research has been invested to optimize the different layers of query processing. Naturally; they have the highest performance in terms of transaction throughput and query latency. However; all along; they have been designed to be centrally managed by a single authority. Hence; no consensus mechanism is required across different parties. Furthermore; centralizes services; servers; datacenter are prone to cyber-attacks Permissionless Blockchains Permissionless Blockchains are public ledgers that are not managed by a centralized authority. That is; the ledger is distributed across a dynamic network of peers. The brilliance of Satoshi; was to present a design that maintains consensus on the distributed state in a dynamic and trustless network. This means that permissionless Blockchains can tolerate a (fraction of the) network with Byzantine or untrusted behavior. As everything comes with a price; the tradeoff here is performance cost (throughput and latency). In Bitcoin; the drastic performance hit is because of the POW protocol itself which by design is slow. In comparison to normal databases; in any permissionless Blockchain; a performance hit is inevitable. Because no matter what; to maintain the consistency of the distributed state; there has to be communication between the different peers in the (geographically distributed) network. Permissioned Blockchains Permissioned Blockchains represent a hybrid design. They are not centralized to a single entity; yet they are authorized to a small set of preselected trusted peers that can write state. Since the database network is not scaled to a large number of public nodes; as in the case for permissionless Blockchains; its performance in terms of throughput and latency is much better. Nonetheless; its performance cannot compete with a centralized database. After looking at these different systems; it is easy to realize that there is no one-size-fits-all solution. Everything is a trade-off. Different applications have different requirements and hence different appropriate solutions. The sole distinction between public and private blockchain is related to who is allowed to participate in the network; execute the consensus protocol and maintain the shared ledger. A public blockchain network is completely open and anyone can join and participate in the network. The network typically has an incentivizing mechanism to encourage more participants to join the network. Bitcoin is one of the largest public blockchain networks in production today. One of the drawbacks of a public blockchain is the substantial amount of computational power that is necessary to maintain a distributed ledger at a large scale. Another disadvantage is the openness of public blockchain; which implies little to no privacy for transactions and only supports a weak notion of security. A private blockchain network requires an invitation and must be validated by either the network starter or by a set of rules put in place by the network starter. Businesses who set up a private blockchain will generally set up a permissioned network. This places restrictions on who is allowed to participate in the network; and only in certain transactions. Commercial Blockchains might use private; permissioned architecture to optimize network openness and scalability Whether to adopt blockchain is not merely a technological decision; it is also a business decision. Great use cases solve real problems at a cost that is significantly lower than the benefits the adoption brings. Blockchain’s unique properties; meaning that a new analytical framework is useful; in part because of the fact that blockchain has emerged at a unique point in society’s technological development. While the application of technology to improve business processes is nothing new; previous generations of technology were predominantly about the faster and more secure exchange of information. Blockchain; meanwhile; is about the exchange of value; it is intended to enable individuals to exchange currency and other assets with one another without relying on a third party to manage the transactions. It also implies the dramatic redefinition of the business processes associated within and between companies. Blockchain Disruption Across Industry Sectors Blockchain’s strategic value is mainly in cost reduction Blockchain might have the disruptive potential to be the basis of new operating models; but its initial impact will be to drive operational efficiencies. Cost can be taken out of existing processes by removing intermediaries or the administrative effort of record keeping and transaction reconciliation. This can shift the flow of value by capturing lost revenues and creating new revenues for blockchain-service providers. Based on a McKinsey survey; “approximately 70 percent of the value at stake in the short term is in cost reduction; followed by revenue generation and capital relief” Value derived from Blockchain technology across industries Characteristics of high‐potential use cases Cryptocurrency’s core advantages are low-fee transferability; ability to transact cross-borders and deflationary character in case of value appreciation/ storage. Blockchain’s main advantages are decentralization; cryptographic security; transparency; and immutability. It allows information to be verified and value to be exchanged without having to rely on a third-party authority.

How DJI Became the Drone Industry’s Most Valued Company,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write How DJI Became the Drone Industry’s Most Valued Company Drone U · Follow 6 min read · Jan 3; 2019 -- DA — Jiang Innovations or DJI is a Shenzen based company with humble origins. Frank Wong funded DJI with his university scholarship money back in 2006. The scenario today; is quite different; to say the least. DJI’s annual sales are estimated at a mammoth $3 billion. And they have nearly 3;000 employees on their roster. As per the latest round of funding in April 2018; DJI is now valued at a cool $15 Billion — which makes Frank the world’s first drone billionaire. So; how has DJI managed to reach this enviable position? Let us segue into our first point — their Chinese origins. Are DJI’s Chinese Production Facilities the Sole Reason for their Success? To attribute DJI’s success simply to low production costs courtesy their Chinese production base is a narrow and incorrect view. Sure; low manufacturing costs are a factor — but certainly not the only one. Drone manufacturing is incredibly complicated and requires mastery over production processes such as injection molding and precision machining. Check out this cool video showing the manufacturing process for a drone frame mold: This is what Tim Cook from Apple had to say when he was asked about manufacturing iPhone's in China- “There’s a confusion about China… the popular conception is that companies come to China because of low labor cost. I’m not sure what part of China they go to but the truth is; China stopped being the low labor cost country many years ago and that is not the reason to come to China from a supply point of view… …the reason is because of the skill… and the quantity of skill in one location… and the type of skill it is. The products we do require really advanced tooling. And the precision that you have to have in tooling and working with the materials that we do are state-of-the-art. And the tooling skill is very deep here”. Clearly; manufacturing of drone parts is also an industry which requires tooling and engineering skills of the highest degree. So while low costs are one of the reasons for DJI’s success; access to skilled labor is an important factor as well. Another strong reason for DJI’s success is their responsiveness to market needs. Mike Winn; co-founder; DroneDeploy points out that using the same technology platform for consumer and enterprise solutions allows DJI to innovate and launch new products with lightning speed. So; this allows a Mavic user to have the same user experience when he upgrades to a Matrice — resulting in faster adoption as well. DJI’s recent partnership with Microsoft will allow DJI users access to the Microsoft ecosystem via a SDK. This will permit drone pilots to offer autonomous and scalable industry solutions. Check out this video to learn more: Competitors Are Finding It Tough to Compete with a Nimble DJI G oPro and DJI certainly make an interesting case study for folks wanting to study market strategy and competition. GoPro; founded in 2002 went public in 2014. Riding on the success of their action cameras; the GoPro stock price touched a high of $87 in October 2014. Today the stock is trading at less than 5 dollars. So what really happened? Arguably; GoPro’s biggest folly was their foray into the drone business — a decision that was fraught with trouble from the get go. After talks of a possible collaboration with DJI and 3DR fell through; GoPro decided to take control of the entire development and manufacturing process. After several delays; Karma was finally launched in late 2016. Citing stiff competition and low margins; GoPro exited the drone business completely in January 2018. In September 2018; GoPro released the Hero 7 which was touted as the “Gimbal Killer”. Well; DJI responded by combining a camera and gimbal to give us the “Osmo Pocket”. Costing $349; the Osmo Pocket is cheaper than the Hero 7 and gives us much sharper footage. This is what Paul Aitken; Drone U Chief Pilot had to say in his blog post; aptly titled; “SAY GOODBYE TO GOPRO; Family Footage Just Became More Enjoyable Thanks to the OSMO Pocket”. “No; cameras with stabilized sensors are not as smooth as the OSMO pocket. Even cameras that boast a stabilized sensor will not compete with a camera like the Osmo pocket. A stabilized sensor can only correct 15–20 degrees on the roll axis”. MOTA CEO; Michael Faro sums up the current market dynamics quite well: “We are not competing with DJI. That corner of the market is filled.” How Is the Ongoing US China Trade War Affecting Markets? L ast month; in response to the ongoing US-China Trade war; GoPro decided to stop manufacturing cameras for the US market in China. But; how have the trade wars affected DJI? Our good friends at DroneDJ reported the hike in prices for the Phantom 4 Pro/Adv Remote Controller to $749 in October 2018. Likewise prices for the Mavic 2 Pro were raised from $1;449 to $1;499 in the month of September. Whether this is in response to increased tariffs for Chinese manufactured goods is still open to speculation. Click HERE for the entire list of Chinese manufactured products that are subject to increased tariffs. This is what Mario Rebello; VP and Country Manager; North America has to say about the impact of increased tariffs on DJI products: “There has been impact. At times we’ll share the cost; and at times we’ll pass along the costs.” According to Bloomberg; DJI is considering moving to location with less tariff regulations. What Does the Future Hold for Drone Markets? W ith primary drone markets like the US experiencing exponential growth; and with countries like India allowing commercial drone operations; there are no signs that the drone market will experience any slowdown in the coming years. In fact; Gartner predicts that the drone market will touch $11 billion by 2020. A strong R & D department and a nimble production line means that DJI is well poised to capture this growth. A willingness to work on wafer thin margins also makes it difficult for new competition to find a firm footing in the market. (It is estimated that DJI made a net profit of $120 million on sales of $1 billion in 2014) @TheDroneGirl reported that DJI’s market share has gone up from 72% in 2017 to 74% in 2018. In 2018; DJI delighted drone users by launching the Ronin S; the Mavic 2; the Phantom 4 RTK and the Osmo Pocket. According to industry rumors; DJI shall be announcing a new Matrice series at CES 2019. There has also been much speculation surrounding Terra; a trademark which was recently registered by DJI. DJI started a new company; DJI Terra B.V. based in Netherlands. Whether Terra is a mapping application or a land based drone; only time will tell.

Is Apple’s Cash Cow In Trouble?,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write Is Apple’s Cash Cow In Trouble? Reality distortion field in full swing over iPhone slowdown Paris Marx · Follow 4 min read · Jan 3; 2019 -- 5 Photo by Ali Abdul Rahman on Unsplash Yesterday; trading of Apple’s stock was briefly paused for CEO Tim Cook to deliver some bad; but not wholly unexpected; news: revenue in Q1 2019 would fall far short of expectations; in large part due to slow iPhone sales. Reports have been coming out for a couple of months suggesting that Apple’s new slate of iPhones — XR; XS; and XS Max — were not selling as much as the company had expected; and now that’s been confirmed. When Apple reported its Q4 2018 numbers; it provided Q1 2019 guidance of $89 billion to $93 billion in revenue and a gross margin between 38 to 38.5 percent. Cook now says Q1 revenue will be closer to $84 billion — $5 billion below even its low-end target — and gross margin will come in at around 38 percent. But why is revenue; in particular; so much lower than expected? At least that’s what Tim Cook wants us to believe. In Cook’s letter to investors; he singles out China as the main “challenge” the company faced in meeting its revenue targets; in particular the lower-than-expected iPhone sales in the region — but problems with the iPhone line go beyond Greater China. Apple has placed far too much attention on its share price in recent years; and now the issues with Apple’s product line are coming back to bite it. Any slowdown in the iPhone line is a huge problem for Apple because it alone accounted for nearly 63 percent of the company’s revenue in fiscal year 2018. When the iPhone falters; Apple falters — which makes all the stock buybacks and dividend increases Cook has spent the past several years pursuing to please investors useless. In explaining the lower iPhone revenues; Cook blames lower carrier subsidies; a stronger US dollar; and cheaper battery replacements — the latter of which he positioned as a benevolent move by the company in an interview with CNBC when it was actually a response to a massive scandal over slowing down batteries in older iPhones. While these things may have contributed to lower sales; they miss the bigger challenge that Apple is facing with the iPhone line; and the way Cook completely ignores it in his letter illustrates how the reality distortion field is still in full swing among Apple executives; and could ultimately be hindering them from addressing the real problem. In that same interview with CNBC; Cook says that carrier are offering lower subsidies; so for customers who have been out of the market for two to three years and are returning to get a new phone; everything looks more expensive. Except phones don’t just look more expensive; they are more expensive. Apple has been slowly increasing the price of iPhones for years; to the point where the cheapest of its new models now costs $749; but there are also base models for $999 and $1099 — higher prices are a trend across the whole product line. These prices are in large part a response to the significant decline in iPhone sales growth as the smartphone markets in the United States and China has become saturated. Since sales growth has stalled; average selling price needs to increase to keep overall revenue growing — but even that seems to be becoming a challenge. Despite the issues cited in China; Cook says all-time revenue records were set in the United States; Canada; Germany; Italy; Spain; the Netherlands and Korea. The company has stopped reporting sales numbers; but it’s safe to assume this is a result of higher revenue from its premium phones — the iPhone XS and XS Max — not due to selling many more phones over last year. Apple is the iPhone. Sure; its other product lines are doing well; but none comes nearly as close to matching the size and importance to Apple’s bottom line. The company has so far avoided its reckoning with the state of the smartphone market by raising prices; but that strategy is already catching up to it. Even though Cook placed the blame elsewhere; there can be no doubt that higher iPhone prices are a contributing factor to the slowdown; it’s getting harder and harder to justify an upgrade; and raising prices again isn’t going to make it any easier.

Capture Stereoscopic Images and Video with the Raspberry Pi-Based StereoPi,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write Capture Stereoscopic Images and Video with the Raspberry Pi-Based StereoPi Cabe Atwell · Follow 2 min read · Jan 3; 2019 20 The Raspberry Pi Compute Module was designed with industrial and automation applications in mind; but it can be tasked for much more; including a pair of cameras for grabbing stereoscopic images and video. That’s the idea behind the StereoPi — a carrier board; which can also be used for computer vision; drone; and robot projects. The open source board is compatible with all Compute Modules (1; 3; 3+) and runs Raspbian right out of the box. The StereoPi supports the Raspberry Pi Compute Module; along with the OV5647 and Sony IMX 219 cameras. (📷: StereoPi) The StereoPi boasts a pair of CSI camera ports (supporting OV5647 and Sony IMX 219 cameras); micro USB port; micro SD card slot; a couple of USB ports; 1X USB header; HDMI; Ethernet; SO-DIMM connector; 5V power connector; on/off power switch; boot mode jumper; and a 40-pin GPIO header — all packed into a 90 x 40mm footprint. This board is the ultimate interface between two cameras and a Compute Module. (📷: StereoPi) The StereoPi is versatile and has already been employed in some real world applications — such as pairing it with an Oculus Rift to render people in a third-person view; using it with ROS for simple depth-mapping; and stitching 360-degree panoramic images. Of course; the StereoPi can be used for a myriad of other applications; like building computer vision systems with OpenCV; live streaming video directly to YouTube from drone and robotic platforms; and even creating your own augmented and virtual reality systems. Beyond Raspbian and ROS; the board can be programmed using Python; C; and C++; depending on the project. The StereoPi isn’t yet available; however a batch of them have entered pre-production and have been thoroughly tested; which means they will go on to post-production shortly and will soon appear on Crowd Supply. UPDATE: StereoPi’s campaign has now launched on Crowd Supply; starting at $69 for the ‘slim edition’ and $89 for the ‘standard’ board. Starter and deluxe kits are also available for $125 and $199; respectively. Sign up to discover human stories that deepen your understanding of the world. Free Distraction-free reading. No ads.

Apple’s Cook Faces Toughest Test Yet Navigating iPhone Slowdown,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write Member-only story Apple’s Cook Faces Toughest Test Yet Navigating iPhone Slowdown Bloomberg · Follow Published in Bloomberg · 4 min read · Jan 3; 2019 91 1 Photo: Stephanie Keith/Getty Images By Mark Gurman Apple Inc.’s Tim Cook confirmed Wednesday that the latest iPhones; his flagship product; are not selling up to expectations. The news exposes his toughest challenge since taking over as chief executive officer from the legendary Steve Jobs: how to take the company forward when its top product has lost luster with consumers. Cook has dealt with a series of controversies during his more than seven years in the role; ranging from the company’s failed Google Maps replacement launch and the need to oust the head of iPhone software in 2012; to concerns over labor and tax practices. He has calmly navigated the politics of President Donald Trump’s administration; and so far has avoided tariffs on the company’s key devices as the U.S.-China trade war widens. Now comes the disclosure in a letter to investors that Apple sold fewer than anticipated new iPhones; and would cut its holiday quarter sales outlook by as much as $9 billion. Cook plans to address Apple staff about the situation on Thursday at an all-hands meeting where he will take questions from workers; according to a person familiar with the matter. “This is probably one of the hardest things Tim Cook has had to do as CEO; putting out that letter today;” said Michael Gartenberg; a former Apple marketing executive who has followed the company for decades. Daniel Ives; an analyst at Wedbush Securities; said “this is going to be the most defining moment of Cook’s career.” When he succeeded co-founder Jobs in 2011; Cook was well regarded for his supply chain mastery. He’s leaned on lieutenants like design chief Jony Ive and marketing head Phil Schiller to dream up new devices. He’s also benefited largely from the success of the iPhone. It generates about two-thirds of the company’s sales; but it produces much more revenue when accounting for services like Apple Music and attached devices like the AirPods and Apple Watch. The stock price has gained 194 percent since Cook took the top job; share buybacks have been strong; and annual revenue has more than doubled. The iPhone’s average sales price; revenue and unit sales have increased. That has allowed investors and analysts to mostly ignore the lack of new… Create an account to read the full story.

How Children Interact with Digital Media,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write Member-only story How Children Interact with Digital Media Parents may loathe them; but they are here to stay The Economist · Follow 8 min read · Jan 4; 2019 265 1 Photo: Marvin Recinos/Getty Images “T urn off media; turn on life”; urges the promotional video from South Korea’s Nori Media Education Centre for the Prevention of Internet Addiction; an organisation funded by a mixture of private and public money. Its manager; Kwon Jang-hee; is passionate about protecting children from the ill effects of the internet; and above all of smartphones; which he considers most damaging of all because of their omnipresence. Parents do not understand how dangerous the internet is; he says; pointing to a study by Seoul National University that detected similarities between the brain activity of cocaine addicts and computer-games enthusiasts. If he had his way; youngsters would have to wait for their smartphones until they had graduated from high school. In one of the world’s most highly connected societies there is little chance that he will get his wish; but plenty of South Korean parents agree that their children are overdosing on screens. A recent government survey on smartphone and internet addiction put the share of three- to nine-year-olds at high risk of addiction at 1.2% and that of teenagers at 3.5%. That may not seem a lot; but when it happens the effects can be devastating. Some of these children are on their phones for at least eight hours a day and lose interest in offline life. Having tried and failed to wean them from their devices; their desperate parents turn to the government; which offers various kinds of counselling; therapy and; in extreme cases; remedial boot camps. Hong Hyun-joo; who works on the boot-camp programme for the regional government of Gyeonggi; South Korea’s most populous province; says the kids undergoing the treatment are usually aged 14–16; with about the same number of boys and girls. They hand in their smartphones when they arrive at the boot camp and spend 12 days living in dormitories; eating regular meals and engaging in lots of sport and group activities. The aim is to increase their self-esteem and get them to make friends. They mostly start off sullen but gradually become more co-operative. The claimed “cure” rate (meaning a return to more normal usage) is 70–75%. But the camps can take only a few hundred children a year; not remotely enough to meet demand.

Keri Savoca · Follow Published in The Startup · 8 min read · Jan 3; 2019 3 I wrote an article in mid-December that went “viral” and amassed over 20;000 views in the first day. Of course; I was disappointed when my other articles didn’t get much attention; but when I took a look at my erratic earnings; I realized that I had stumbled upon a golden opportunity to closely examine Medium’s stats — beyond fans and claps. Analysis of Medium’s Stats Buckle up; I was serious when I said that this is going to be an in-depth analysis. I will examine the following: number of fans number of claps whether the article was distributed by Medium’s editors whether the article was published independently or in a publication how non-member articles compared I will attempt to determine: whether fans or claps are a better indicator of earnings whether it is possible to earn money from non-distributed articles whether articles in publications earn more than articles published independently 1. Viral; distributed; in a publication What Happened When I Cancelled My Home Internet And Why I Never Resubscribed theascent.pub I earned $241.96 for this article; which was published on December 18. The article received 22;000 views and ~1;000 claps in the first 24 hours; which was reflected in Week 4 below. The remaining views and claps are reflected in Week 5. This is the only one of my articles that keeps getting nearly 1;000 views per day; so for this one; I will do my calculations based on the stats I had on Sunday; when the pay period ended. They were roughly: 33;000 views 14;000 reads 1;900 claps 286 fans Possible outlier: 21;000 views came from Flipboard; sometime between 1 and 4 hours after publishing; while I slept. This article was added to The Ascent a day afterwards. However; those 21;000 views on day 1 only resulted in ~200 claps; most of which were from non members. The remaining 15;000 views (and claps from Medium members) came from within Medium; immediately after distribution and publication in The Ascent. Distributed? Yes Publication? The Ascent Approximate value of each clap: $0.13 Approximate value of each fan: $0.84 2. Non-viral; distributed; in a publication Why I Wish I Hadn’t Gone to College or grad school; or grad school again theascent.pub 700 views 325 reads 295 claps 21 fans Distributed? Yes Publication? The Ascent Approximate value of each clap: $0.04 Approximate value of each fan: $0.68 3. Non-viral; distributed; not in a publication Uber’s New Minimum Wage and why it hasn’t yet gone into effect medium.com 146 views 92 reads 28 claps 3 fans Distributed? Yes Publication? N/A Approximate value of each clap: $0.00 Approximate value of each fan: $0.01 This article received claps from 3 people — all Medium members. One left 26 claps; and the other 2 left 1 clap each. 4. Non-viral; not distributed; in a publication Remembering Y2K a collection of news coverage from December 1999 medium.com 56 views 15 reads 38 claps 1 fan Distributed? No Publication? The Startup Approximate value of each clap: $0.00 Approximate value of each fan: $0.01 5. Non-viral; not distributed; not in a publication 10 New Year’s Resolutions That Anyone Can Keep 1. Be kind to others. medium.com 29 views 12 reads 46 claps 3 fans Distributed? No Publication? No Approximate value of each clap: $0.00 Approximate value of each fan: $0.00 6. Non-viral; not distributed; in a publication; free article Note: see below for an update about free articles that are not in publications. Making Medium Visual — All The Things You Can Embed in Your Stories Let’s move beyond plain text and stock images. writingcooperative.com This one was published on December 24 and is listed as still awaiting review by Medium’s editors; probably because I had made it a members-only article inadvertently; and the publication had to change this. 230 views 114 reads 246 claps 24 fans Distributed? No Publication? The Writing Cooperative Approximate value of each clap: N/A Approximate value of each fan: N/A Conclusions Value of claps and fans: Claps were not a reliable predictor of earnings overall.  The value of a clap varied; from $0.00 on articles with hardly any views or fans; to $0.13 on an article that has; to date; received 2;200 claps.   Fans were a more interesting measure; the number of fans was directly proportional to the value of each fan.  For articles with single-digit fans; the value of each fan was around 1 cent.  For articles with double-digit fans; the value of each fan was between $0.60 and $0.68 cents (I only included one article in my analysis; but the data was almost the same for other articles with similar reads; views; claps; and fans).  For the viral article with triple-digit fans; the value of each fan was $0.84 cents. Takeaway: The value of each clap and fan increases as an article gains more visibility. This could be because Medium members who clap on these articles don't do a lot of clapping and only interact with articles that appear on the homepage on the rare occasion that they log in.  It is also possible that Medium's algorithm rewards articles that gain significant exposure.   Effects of distribution and publications: Distribution by Medium’s editors usually affected whether an article received enough exposure to generate revenue.  There was a single exception; but the article was for a very small niche.  Being in a publication did not have a predictable effect; almost all of my articles are in publications; but those that were not distributed received single-digit views each day and earned pennies (if anything). This includes an article that was published in The Startup; which has over 400;000 followers. Takeaway: The biggest piece of advice that prominent authors give to new authors is to get your writing into publications. Unfortunately; the data suggests that this advice; while well-intentioned; is not necessarily the best advice if you are hoping to gain significant exposure (read: earn money). A better piece of advice (if you are hoping to make money) is to write articles that are likely to be distributed. Familiarize yourself with Medium's curation guidelines; and read articles that have been distributed to see what editors are looking for.  Worthy of note is that Medium might not ever review your story for distribution; their curation guidelines state that not all articles will be reviewed. Keep this in mind. Stats for members only vs. free articles: There have been plenty of assertions here on Medium that the algorithm favors members-only stories; but what people really mean to say is that Medium only distributes articles that are for members. Free articles are ineligible for distribution. The data is clear that distribution plays a significant role in whether an article will gain exposure within Medium (although this has little to no effect on whether an article has the potential to go viral from external referrals). As this is a free article; I can issue a call to action. Feel free to clap (in the name of science) to help me gather data for a future update. Updates forthcoming: I will return with a link to a follow-up article with three updates. 1. A more detailed update about members-only articles that are distributed in topics but not in a publication. 2. An update about free articles to determine whether the Medium algorithm really favors members-only articles; as claimed by quite a few authors here. I hypothesize that this is not the case. If you choose to publish a free article; you acknowledge that your article will only be visible to your followers and to the followers of any publication that accepts it... but what does the data tell us about whether our own followers interact with our free articles? Do they really not see it on their feeds as often as they see members-only articles? I'll publish a handful of free articles -- some in publications; some not -- and collect some data. 3. An update about whether articles added to publications AFTER being published are indeed not favored by Medium's algorithm.  A lot of assertions are made about this; so for the sake of science; I'm submitting this one to The Startup after publication.

Logic Theory — Equivalency,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write Member-only story Logic Theory — Equivalency Part IV — Using Truth Tables To Prove Equal Statements Jesus Najera · Follow Published in Towards Data Science · 5 min read · Jan 3; 2019 -- Originally Published: https://www.setzeus.com/ Part III of this series culminated with a rudimentary understanding of truth tables. We walked through two separate examples; mapping both a negation & an implication. You might’ve realized; however; that while we’ve applied truth tables to evaluate compound premises; we’ve yet to prove any sort of equivalency between two or more statements. This article extends our knowledge of truth tables by focusing on one; rather involved; final example. Instead of mapping out a single compound premise; we’ll directly compare two compound premises in order prove that they’re logically equivalent. Specifically; the following two statements: Statement #1: (P ^ Q) -> P Statement #2: P -> (P ⌄ Q) This time we will not provide our two premises with further context like we did in the previous example — why? in order to drive home the point that it’s not required. The process for creating a truth table does not change; we strictly care about the individual truth & false values stemming from every possible scenario. So How Do We Prove Equivalency For The Two Above Using Truth Tables? Easy; by creating a massive truth table that compares the two final columns of both statements. We first calculate the individual truth & false values of both Statement #1 & Statement #2; then; afterwards; compare these final values in order to prove (or disprove) that they’re logically equivalent. We’ll see this clearly in the final truth table near the end if you’d like to skip ahead. For now though; we’ll start from scratch. Let’s tackle Statement #1. Constructing Statement #1 Instead of deriving the scenarios for all of (P ^ Q) -> P at once; let’s take it apart to two main pieces. Ignore the implication part of the statement (->P) & we’re left with a much more manageable statement. With two premises & a single connective (the conjunction/and); we can deduce that our Partial Statement #1 table requires a total of three columns & four rows: -- Written by Jesus Najera 2.7K Followers · Writer for  Towards Data Science Owner @ SetDesign; NightKnight & CryptoSpace | Product Designer | Hobbyist Mathematician | VR Developer | MS in Finance @ UF Follow,['Logic Theory — Equivalency'],Jesus Najera,https://setzeus.medium.com/?source=post_page-----f5251af2b549--------------------------------,5 min read,Jan 3  2019,https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:4272/1*6alicB2Cx3nIseEVmEHMlA.jpeg
Alternatives to Superintelligence,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write Alternatives to Superintelligence Surviving Superintelligence: part 4 of 4 LeeAnn Felder-Heim · Follow Published in O’Humanity · 3 min read · Jan 3; 2019 76 1 In part 3 we decided that it is possible for humans — through collective organizing — to exert some control over technological developments. This brought us to two important questions: What would be required to impede the deployment of SI? And; How can we make sure that happens? In regards to the what question; we can use nuclear monitoring and Mutually Assured Destruction as a model. If many world powers create artificially intelligent agents that are poised to crossover to HLMI and then to SI; and these world powers monitor each other and set up ICBMs to destroy HLMI agents that have been “deployed;” a stalemate could be achieved. This theory assumes that we will be able to successfully monitor HLMI development. While HLMI development cannot be monitored by environmental monitoring; advances in specialized technologies could facilitate monitoring of government entities and corporations with the capacity to develop HLMI. An analog to the Bioweapons Anti-Terrorism Act could be enacted to criminalize private citizens developing HLMI. While monitoring all private citizens capable of developing HLMI would be challenging; the level of computing power and specialized skills required would shrink the pool significantly. Nuclear weapon test Dakota You might be thinking — do we really want to create an international monitoring agency that will monitor private citizens with powerful computers? Idon’t want that. But I really don’t want to jump on the Bostrom train either — pushing down the gas pedal on SI development and putting the hopes of human survival into a highly uncertain method for controlling SI. Would a global monitoring system be any less dystopic than the various possible existential catastrophes Bostrom outlines? We have accepted monitoring systems for nuclear testing; and we were close to doing the same for biological weapons — why wouldn’t we do the same for an equally terrifying threat to human survival? Side note: A halt on HLMI deployment does not mean a halt on all technological developments. Halting HLMI would not; for instance; impede important medical advances that use machine learning but are extremely specialized. These medical devices; while incredible; are not “generally intelligent;” and neither — for that matter — are self-driving cars or SIRI. Just because technologies do certain human tasks very well (e.g. driving or speech recognition); does not mean that they have Human Level Machine Intelligence (being able to do almost all human tasks as well as the average human). In regards to how question; I think that the progression of artificial intelligence improvements will naturally attract mass interest in SI. Huge numbers of people will be pushed out of jobs due to improvements in specific artificial intelligence. If those people can be made to see that mechanization is the true driving force behind their suffering — rather than being distracted by scapegoats like globalization and Mexicanization — then there might be enough anti technological advance momentum to impact political decisions. Maybe when 3.4 million Americans are replaced by self-driving vehicles mechanization’s downsides will become unavoidably obvious. But; we must not assume that it will. To impede the power of scapegoating; we need to spread this discussion to the people who will be most impacted by job loss from specialized AI. Spreading idiosyncratic discussion about SI deployment is key in preventing scapegoating and in guiding people toward positive action. Clear understanding of SI is required for funneling energy toward the requisite international organizing that can impede its deployment. Without a clear understanding of SI; anger about the suffering caused by mechanization could easily lead to chaos. We must avoid the destructive and ineffective machine-smashing coup that ends Kurt Vonnegut’s novel; Player Piano; and instead offer effective and peaceful means for people to express their indignation. In Player Piano; the “revolutionaries” burn a city to the ground; are defeated and captured; and then offer each other the self-satisfied toast: “To the record.” But we must not be satisfied with changing “the record.” We must only be satisfied by changing the world.

Why a business shouldn’t fail if it thinks about UX from the get-go,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write Member-only story Why a business shouldn’t fail if it thinks about UX from the get-go A fictional walk-through of a foundational UX scenario. Kristopher Saber · Follow Published in UX Collective · 4 min read · Jan 3; 2019 27 In the domain of User Experience; one popular thought pattern seems to prevail; UX is limited to the digital space. But this is not true. UX is something that is deeply rooted in the foundation of the business as I’ve talked about in the past here. I’m going to walk-through a practical example of what I meant in the previous article. Let’s take a business right from the very inception. It’s you and your buddy-you’re both talking over drinks. You two have been talking out an idea for a new service that’s going to revolutionize how people watch shows. It specifically streams series and movies that can be viewed in Virtual Reality (VR); and the service even sends you an Oculus Go when you sign up for a yearly subscription. Your friend is convinced that this idea will make you two millions: “Who doesn’t want to watch series in VR?” Your friend says. Knowing a thing or two about UX; you’ve been conditioned to ask a lot of questions. You respond to your friend “That’s a good question. Who doesn’t want to watch series in VR?” Your friend pauses in a look of concern. “I don’t know; isn’t VR just better?” You two have a back and forth But at the end of it you both agree that more user research has to be done before you start implementing your idea. You two start from the beginning. What is our VR streaming service going to accomplish for users? What problems is it solving? “Well it’s going to make viewing series a lot more engaging since it’s in VR” your friend mentions “Yeah but is that really solving a problem?” you counter. You have another back and forth “Well it’s making it convenient for people who love VR series to watch it all on one seamless app; specifically designed from the ground up to handle VR series. All the features are designed to make VR shows easier to access and digest.” Your friend exclaims. “All right; that makes sense.” You both say at the same time. You both agree that you have to find a sub population of people that actually like watching series; shows; and simulations in VR. You’ve concluded that… Create an account to read the full story.

Doing Data the Right Way,Open in app Sign up Sign in Write Member-only story Doing Data the Right Way The Ethics of Data Science Yish Lim · Follow Published in Towards Data Science · 10 min read · Jan 3; 2019 -- 2 (from: robynmac on Depositphotos) T he notion of ethics in Data Science first occurred to me when I was learning how to scrape the web for data. Newly-equipped with the ability to easily capture and store any information merely printed online; I was having fun scraping different websites just for the sake of it. Then; upon trying to scrape Reddit; I got this message: whoa there; pardner! Web scraping albeit tedious is a powerful tool. Bigger websites like Reddit have measures like the above to stop us from getting too much information at once. And looking at the message above; we can still get this information; just not all at once. Web scraping is one of the first things we learn as Data Scientists; and within a month of my foray into the field of Data Science; I had the power to store pretty much any information written on any webpage online. And with great power comes great responsibility. Surely people out there could misuse their web scraping powers for evil. We live in the Age of Information where so much data exists and is continually being generated. Information is now an integral part of life and society; and with that comes the need to know how to manage it. The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) actually published the Software Engineering Code of Ethics in 1999; outlining 8 principles software engineers should adhere to “in accordance with their commitment to the health; safety and welfare of the public.” The Code of Ethics offers a guide to the behavior and decision-making of software engineers; and it is (simply put) very utilitarian. For example; the very first principle states that “software engineers shall act consistently with the public interest.” The following principles also go along the lines of doing good and maximizing the amount of good that comes out of software. Data Science is a field even newer than Software Engineering. In 2018 we saw events such as the Cambridge Analytica/Facebook debacle and the EU implementing the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR); both relating to Big Data and how to deal with the information we have online. Big Data is inevitably going to have a great impact on the… -- 2 Written by Yish Lim 320 Followers · Writer for  Towards Data Science Machine Learning Engineer @ Treasure Data https://www.linkedin.com/in/yishuen-lim/ Follow,['Doing Data the Right Way'],Yish Lim,https://medium.com/@yishuen?source=post_page-----dbf5ba658177--------------------------------,10 min read,Jan 3  2019,https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*UCdEQaoU1RffdX8Nx_V6wA.jpeg
